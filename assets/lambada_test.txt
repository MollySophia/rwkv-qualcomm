In my palm is a clear stone, and inside it is a small ivory statuette. A guardian angel.

"Figured if you're going to be out at night getting hit by cars, you might as well have some backup."

I look at him, feeling stunned. Like this is some sort of sign. But as I stare at Harlin, his mouth curved in a confident grin, I don't care about signs|Give me a minute to change and I'll meet you at the docks." She'd forced those words through her teeth.

"No need to change. We won't be that long."

Shane gripped her arm and started leading her to the dock.

"I can make it there on my own, Shane|"Only one source I know of that would be likely to cough up enough money to finance a phony sleep research facility and pay people big bucks to solve crimes in their dreams," Farrell concluded dryly.

"What can I say?" Ellis unfolded his arms and widened his hands. "Your tax dollars at work."

Before Farrell could respond, Leila's voice rose from inside the house.

"No insurance?" she wailed. "What do you mean you don't have any insurance|Helen's heart broke a little in the face of Miss Mabel's selfless courage. She thought that because she was old, her life was of less value than the others'. For all Helen knew, Miss Mabel had a lot more years to live than she did. "Not going to happen," replied Helen|Preston had been the last person to wear those chains, and I knew what I'd see and feel if they were slipped onto my skin-the Reaper's unending hatred of me. I'd felt enough of that emotion already in the amphitheater. I didn't want to feel anymore.

"Don't put those on me," I whispered. "Please."

Sergei looked at me, surprised by my low, raspy please, but he put down the chains|She knew that Basha was a decent young man, that he was pretty sweet and friendly with her. Jawen knew they had a bit of a history, but she thought that this time she would get along better with him, that she could overlook those problems. 
They kissed, and she knew that she liked Basha, but then Hastin interfered. She was so angry that she immediately said, once they were out of earshot of Basha, “You don’t mean anything to me anymore, Hastin|He heard Rhinna speak “The Queen wants you in her carriage.” 
Tom spoke “No, I’m not going in some asylum.” 
Ran was seen standing next to him spoke “It’s just for a private talk with you that’s all.” 
Tom groaned and went inside the carriage to sit down next to the Queen|There was no way he would come here on his own. 
He ordered a cup of coffee, and then we just sat in silence. 
“So,” Aidan finally said, “How’s it going?”
I laughed. “Not much has changed since the last time I saw you.”
“Ya know, you eat here a lot,” said Aidan|“Why?”
“I would have thought you’d find him rather dry,” she said.
“I don’t know about that,” said Gabriel.
“He was a great craftsman,” said Heather.
“That he was,” said Flannery.
“And Polish, to boot,” said Gabriel|Both its sun-speckled shade and the cool grass beneath were a welcome respite after the stifling kitchen, and I was glad to relax against the tree’s rough, brittle bark and begin my breakfast of buttery, toasted bread and fresh fruit. Even the water was tasty, it was so clean and cold. It almost made up for the lack of coffee|Escorting drunk humans out of the bar is different from going up against a tiger-wildcat who eats raw steak for breakfast and is dying for a fight."

"I bet he could win with just his breath," Ronan said. Sean chuckled.

"Take it seriously, Ronan. These guys are seasoned. If Marquez has a champion, it means he's won a good share of the fights|Instead, I stare straight ahead like I'm deeply interested in what's going on at the front of the room.

Eventually, we make it through to the part where everyone stands up and says their little piece. Some have a longer, more in depth story to tell, which terrifies me. I don't want anyone to ask me for my story|Recall our encounter with the warbirds at the Federation border. Confirm my memory with yours.”
She turned Seren to face her. They placed their foreheads together as when they meditated together. They held hands beneath the surface of the water. They closed their eyes.
“There were five warbirds at the border|I was so happy to see him that I almost sobbed his name.
Eli stiffened and let out a hiss. “Mohiri!” Fear crept into his voice, and my dazed mind wondered what on earth scared a vampire.
Nikolas chuckled, and I felt a tremor run through my captor. “I see there is no need for introductions|"Come on, baby girl," Mary Jo said, scooping up the toy, then bending to retrieve her daughter. "Let me change your diaper and put you down for a couple of hours."

"She sleeps that long?"

"Almost every afternoon. She still takes a morning nap, too, but she'll outgrow those pretty soon."

Lori knew she had a lot to learn about babies|I would really like to have some time with my mom."

Lucien groaned inwardly. How could he say no to that? Julia was grieving for her mate and at a loss on how to deal with her daughter. Now Jaeden actually wanted to speak to her mom... he would be an ogre if he said no. He gave a quick nod and ignored the grateful smile she threw him before her and her mother ambled out of the room together|If Demerzel has the ability to change minds, he has to do so without bringing about side effects he does not wish-and since he is the Emperor's First Minister, the side effects he must worry about are numerous, indeed."

"And the application to the present case?"

"Think about it! You can't tell anyone-except me, of course-that Demerzel is a robot, because he has adjusted you so that you can't. But how much adjustment did that take? Do you want to tell people that he is a robot|I leaned out the window and pointed at Floyd’s hearing aid.
Floyd dug the hearing aid out of his ear and made an adjustment. “Sorry,” he said, screwing it back in. “Blasted thing was turned off.”
“What happened to Chester?”
“Shot in the head’s what happened to Chester|‘Well I don’t know why, Nellie showed it to me many times. It has heaps of her poems and short stories in it; mostly girlie stuff though, which is why she obviously didn’t bother showing you. Strange that she left it to you though, I can’t imagine you would enjoy it very much.
‘Are you sure it is the same book|"We'll wait for you, Daddy," Izzy said, snuggling up to Annie.

Nick pressed the book into Izzy's hands and hurried out of the room. He came back a few minutes later, looking solemn.

Annie felt a prickling of fear. She sat up straighter, leaning forward. "Nick?"

He eased back into the bed, on the other side of Izzy|"Michael wanted nothing to do with the business for a very long time," the older woman answered. "He had his heart set on being a race-car driver."

Maggie's mouth fell open. "What?"

"Si. He was very good, though my heart stopped every time he went out on the track. No matter how many times his papa and I tried to discourage him, he found a way back on the track|A cowboy behind her said to break up a cheese slice and mush it down in the mixture.  Sarah took a slice of cheese to do just that.
Sarah and Tess sat at one of the large tables with other guests.  Everyone talked and laughed, while eating lunch.  It seemed a happy group. Dale watched from the back to make sure all was well and to get another look at Sarah|Brayden's face was a mix of incredulity and disappointment when I told him I had to leave.

"But you just... I mean..." It was a rare moment of speechlessness for him.

"I'm sorry," I said earnestly. "Especially after being late and ruining the museum. But it's a family emergency."

"Your family has an awful lot of emergencies|"Thank you," Liz says, her sweaty face going into my neck. "I'm so tired."

"As soon as this is over, you can sleep. I promise."

"Okay." She says softly. The doctor walks in and sits down at the end of the bed.

"Are you ready for this, Liz|Olaf slapped the boy real hard. Bob was momentarily stunned. Olaf then started yelling at him about calling him without permission unless it was emergency. The boy mumbled something crying at the same time. Bob got closer through the woods and stepped on a branch that cracked. Both Olaf and the boy heard it and walked towards Bob|Instead, its twin towers, now horizontal so as to appear like walkways, loomed over the deck of the Hercules, and the black ship stopped impossibly quickly, its movement suddenly halted.
No one moved for a moment and the two ships sat there, doing nothing. Then Lucius saw a movement near the top of the mighty warship as the hooked walkways descended downwards, until they reached down from the deck of the black vessel to the deck of the Hercules|She kisses me again.

"Oh-kay!" Jen whistles. "Can we go now? I don't wanna break up the lovey-dovey show goin' on, but I have shopping to do."

I laugh and release Lexy, wrapping a friendly arm around Jen's shoulders. "Oh, how dull my life would be without you, Jen|His smile widened. “I’ll keep it a secret.”
“Thank you.”
“Can you play?”
“Grace taught me how to play Chopsticks.”
“It’s a good place to start.” He tapped his card on the table. “I’ll think I’ll take another look at the piano|Now, they were opening cans of pork & beans and eating them cold. As to why they didn't heat them up first, it took some prying but Lucas finally admitted that there had been a bit of an accident when they had used the stove and it had caught on fire. The ship was fine but they weren't sure about the stove|I wasn't interested in helping, because I knew it was hopeless. Carla was six feet into a snowdrift almost as tall as my head, and we didn't even have a shovel. I just stood in the road next to the Duke, wiping the wisp of wet hair sticking out under my hat. "Sorry," I said to the Duke|She doesn’t like to talk about it.” Sara looked at Joshua.
“Give her time,” he said gently. “It’s only been a few months.” As they reached Sara’s street, he stopped, pulled her into his arms, and held her for a moment. “I really, really like you, Sara|“But I can be anything you want.”
Kim and Izzy rolled their eyes.
What a character. From his scruffy jeans and threadbare T-shirt, he obviously liked to dress down. Was it to draw attention to his looks or deflect them? I tugged hard and forced him to release my hand. Ignoring him, I gave my attention to Kim|the boy said, looking proud of every word.
"Go on, James," the boy behind him said. Some of the other boys had already headed into the showers and James had been too busy warning Toby. James gave Toby a long dark look then turned and walked on. A moment later Toby followed the boy in front of him into the showers|Twice Jeremy managed to avoid cars spinning out of control, and the number of vehicles that littered the roads was unreal. She was probably just as tired and worn out from being tense.
A little after six, she left a note in the room and trudged her way through the snow to the truck stop’s restaurant and ordered dinner-to-go for both of them.
As she opened the motel room’s door, she called, “Hey, Jeremy|so i do not have to tell you the pressures of doing business.”
“pardon me?”
“i said, you own your own store –”
the pop of a microphone saved us all from oblivion.
i hadn’t given much thought to where Chester Springs had been this whole time. unsolicited question answered by his voice. rich and buttery, pouring generously through a pair of speakers|Dylan of the Shed, you are named Guardian of the Portal, do you accept this Quest to protect the portal?”
“I guess.”
“Do you?” Btolomy boomed.
“I do,” he said and could feel his Dad’s eyes on him.
“Connor of the Shed, you too have been named. Do you accept this Quest to protect the portal|"Clear as a bell," she said with more than a little sarcasm. "So where are Mr. Zellerbach and the RV?"

"In Syracuse, New York, of course."

She frowned. "Enlighten me."

" `Hart's erroneous comedy.' "

"That tells you he's in Syracuse|We only want to talk to you.”
Ishmael briefly wondered who lied, the soldier or the President, or perhaps neither, but he reached up, pulled down the lever and crawled through the vanes.
The razor sharp fan blades slowed until he could count them; five. There would be enough space to crawl between when they were stopped|I used to give Asher and Trevor a hard time about the way they acted when they both met their one...now I knew. I would die for Lilly; she was amazing, beautiful, and kind, and made me want to be a better person.

My phone rang from my pocket, bringing me out of my thoughts. I pulled it out, expecting it to be Lilly|Ellen asked him.

"Yes, indeed," Mark said. "Several."

"Have you ever made a list?"

"I can't say I have, Ellen. Do you recommend it?"

"Oh, yes," Ellen returned seriously. "It's helpful if you have a real list|The second biker had dismounted and was hanging his helmet on the handlebars of his motorcycle when he caught sight of Joran. Without breaking eye contact, he walked up to Joran’s table.
“Cigarette for me?” Long asked.
Joran hesitated before pulling the pack of cigarettes from his shirt pocket and shaking one loose for Long. Long lit the cigarette and took a slow drag on it without ever taking his eyes off of Joran|The bat's gums were pulled back over his teeth in a snarl. "I do not take orders from you, Overlander. Let us be clear on this from the start. I do not take orders from you!"

"Whoa!" said Gregor, startled by Ares's intensity. "What's your problem?"

"My problem is that at this moment, you are reminding me a great deal of Henry," said Ares|They just would have argued with me about it like they always do. And then, when I didn't eat my lunch? Well, you would have thought that I'd tried to jump out the window. I'm upset, and I have every right to be upset. When I get upset, I don't eat|She and Zach were covered in dust and sweat when Helen found them. "Wow, Lexi! You rock."

Lexi groaned at the bad pun.

Helen surveyed the work, which was nearly complete. "How did you do this?"

Lexi shrugged. "Don't know."

"It's her gift," said Zach|"That’s what I said, and I meant it," Bob answers.
"Think of something else." Greg says. He turns around in the front seat to look at Skinner squirm.
"Maybe a gentle rain or taking a cold shower..."
More laughter erupts from his friends. There’s nothing more amusing to a bunch of boys than watching one of them squirm|"We could go back,"I suggested weakly. "Tel them their magical road thingie didn't work for us."

But Jenna shook her head. "It can't be that bad,"she muttered.

"We could try to go together,"I said. "I think we'd both fit, and that way, if we end up transported to another dimension or morphed into a wal , at least we'd have company|His gentle voice did me in. Tears seeped from my eyes. I had to make them stop. Big, bad werewolf hunters did not cry. Petite, blond girlie-girls did. They also got their families murdered before their eyes while powerless to do anything about it. I was no longer that girl; I was the hunter|"If you wanted me to have a happy birthday, you'd come over to my party. "

"Your party," I repeated flatly.

"Yeah, remember? Andrea invited you?"

I remembered. I'd been thinking about it every day this week.

"I didn't think I was still invited|I'd have felt sorry for her if my own nerves hadn't been stretched to the breaking point.

We said nothing for a while. Mum looked out the window again.

"So I'm a ruby," I said. "Those are red, aren't they?"

Mum nodded.

"And what gemstone is Charlotte?"

"She isn't one," said Mum|More and more creepy zombie- looking ghosts would reach out of the waters to try and grab onto the boat.    
The boat came to a stop at a dock leading up to a giant circular black platform with giant black pillars sticking up around the sides.    
“Well, this is your stop, the Soulkeeper’s Passageway,” said the boat guide. 
Shortly, Muri and Joe were standing in the center of the giant platform|The whole mechanism looked rather like a combined television and video player might look, if it had been invented and built three hundred years ago by Sir Isaac Newton. Which was, more or less, exactly what it was.

"Watch," said Door. She placed the wooden ball onto a platform. Lights shone through the machine and into the ball|Mike drove for fear that Jake was so nervous he would get another ticket before he got to the driver’s licensing facility.
He walked with Jake into the building and stood beside him as he presented his form to the official. “How long do I have to finish the test?” Jake asked nervously.
The official looked at his form and input his driver’s license number into the computer and asked, “What test|I'm just used to working, so me not working is messing with my head. I love being home with both the kids, but..." she trails off, shaking her head.

"But what?" I ask when her face pales slightly.

"Um...I...it's nothing." She shakes her head again and I know it's not nothing|In the diagram, he pinched to the left of him, where the ground would be, and pulled up a trail of yellow that formed itself into a seat.
Argus watched as a small hatch opened up from the floor. An outline of the chair was imprinted in light, the seat and the back drawn into space by blue lasers. A tiny black cloud made of nanomachines streamed out of the hatch|`You're all crazy if you think I'll pose as a Krull refugee to do your bidding,' said Luke.  After all I heard tonight I'll be looking to save my own sweet self before I'll be looking to help you ladies capture any walled cities.'

`You're not thinking clearly, Luke, honey,' said Casilevatates.  `Let me remind you why you're going to masquerade as a Krull refugee|Now seemed like as terrible a time as any to trade out my worries that Gregory had somehow found out about the Garzas – or the vain hope that Zach could bring himself to lie to a Gardener about it if asked – for some brand new anxiety. Gregory might have been good only for repeating Thorn, but the High Gardener was smart.
"Thorn wants to speak to you himself. He asked for my best," said Gregory|Bryn smirked as she said loudly, “Have a nice day.”  Kayla’s step did not even falter.  She just continued walking toward the door.  Bryn nudged Nicole and whispered, “Say something.”
Nicole looked confused, but eventually said, “Have a nice day.”
Kayla turned her head a little as she said, “You too|I just need to grab my things and we can go."

She took another step back and bumped into a body. "Chloe, sorry," she said as she glanced over her shoulder.

"No biggie." She pinched Addie in the back, a clear signal she wanted an introduction.

"Trent, this is my cousin, Chloe|It was the only section of the library where there wasn't a single book to check out.

"Good luck with that," Daniel said, opening up his sketchbook again, as if to say, preemptively, goodbye.

Luce was tongue-tied and embarrassed and what she would have liked to do was escape. But then, there were the shadows, still lurking nearby, and for some reason Luce felt better about them when she was next to Daniel|"Happy to help my little friend here, even if she is keeping surprising company," said Leo, giving Tessa a wry look. "Glad you've got a school you like, though."

"How do you want to be credited if I do cite you?" asked Daphne, taking out her ego. "Tessa said you work here and for the government."

"Government stuff's freelance and unrelated," said Leo|Beth smoothed her wiry half-black, half-gray hair from her makeup-free face. In New Mexico, the natural look was common. Standing next to Cindy Fanucci, she felt like a disaster. She hid her ragged nails under the sleeves of her sweatshirt.
“Hi, I’m Cindy. It’s so nice to meet you, Beth|"I'm not done here."

"But-"

"And I'm not your f**king meal," he added, a touch of heat whipping through his words.

So he had heard that part. Cassie had thought his enhanced hearing would pick it up.

The redhead glared at Dante, then at Cassie|He had the ridiculous desire to chase after her, but even as the thought skated tantalizingly through his mind, reality intruded.

"You know, I'm beginning to think there's something going on between you two."

Cheyenne stood behind Hardy, arms crossed over her chest, chin set at an argumentative angle.

Hardy sighed, turning to walk away from her. "There is nothing going on between us, Cheyenne|He was about to let out a burst of laughter when the wagon came to a screeching halt. All the humor left him at once. Other than the low idle of the engine, everything became dead quiet. Strange mechanical noises crept from the back of the wagon like the sound of gears waking within a clock tower. Then he heard similar noises from the front of the wagon|"My serum Creatinine is high, although everything else within my kidney profile is apparently normal, according to the hospital. So is my potassium, but that could be an artifact, so they say. It apparently comes from eating too many bananas."

"Do you eat bananas?"

"I can think of a whole lot of things to do with bananas|Cooper groaned, and his body sagged back.

"You weren't supposed to be first," Deuce snarled as he lifted the gun and took aim at Cooper's prone form. "But if that's the way you want it, old buddy..."

"No!" Gabrielle threw her body forward and wrapped her arms around Cooper|Talking about it normally bothered me, but with him, I felt I could say anything.

"Everyone said I shouldn't have survived," I explained. "Because of where I sat and the way the car hit the tree. Lissa was really the only one in a secure spot. She and I walked away with only a few scratches|“You know we don’t really need a song.”
“True,” Jenna said, “but I want one. I think we deserve one after all this, don’t you? And anyway, it’s supposed to make the wood burn longer.”
“But why do I have to sing|He shook his head, took a step back and held his hands up as he tried to smile without losing a cigarette.
“Yes you can,” Julia said in a reassuring voice. “I’ve already focused on my friend. You just have to click the shutter, on top, here.”
He nodded sheepishly, through his cigarette away and took the camera|Prince of Alasia begins on the night of the Invasion and describes what happens to twelve-year-old Prince Jaymin after he is forced to flee for his life. In the Enemy’s Service features a young girl and tells the story of those who were not able to escape from the Alasian palace when the enemy invaded. Prince of Malorn begins several months earlier and focuses on the Malornian perspective of the events leading up to the Invasion|Even as he settled back into the cushions of the swing, though, he heard a soft voice: "Mateo."

Nadia looked so beautiful. She wore a soft white dress that outlined every inch of her, and her black hair gleamed in the moonlight. But nothing was as incredible as her eyes as she drank him in. Mateo felt like he could hardly speak. Yet he managed to whisper, "Nadia|Lamla touched his shoulder again.
‘Come away, Kandrigi. You will blind yourself.’
Kandrigi remained glued to the tube. Lamla called Ma-Tin, who took his time about looking around – he was gazing down on the Ka, his assistants on either side of him. He spoke to one, and he reluctantly left his post and came across and helped Lamla pull Kandrigi away from the tube|"Of the two of them, who has the strongest appeal?" he asked.

"Leanne," I said. "Not that I don't like Winter," I added quickly, remembering they were cousins.

"What's the name of the third woman again?"

"Macy Roth." I had no connection with her at all, no way of casually running into her as I had with Leanne|My wife refused to allow me to come to Hong Kong when the plague was at its height and–”
“Your wife, Johanne? You are married at last?”
Johanne grinned. “Well, when a man gets to my age, he starts to need a few home comforts. After my dear mother passed away ten years ago now, I became lonely|And I could ignore the feeling of being owned ... it was a loose ball and chain and I was heady with the power, the attention, the money. Until I met Camille."

He took a deep breath, still not daring to look at Regan. "I knew that Alcroft, who was known as Mr. Tradd in those days, was interested in Camille|There was no cover if someone was guarding the beach.  All remained quiet except for the sound of the breakers and smell of decaying seaweed.
No words were spoken as one of the SEALS opened the sled and Peter began stripping out of his dive gear and into civilian clothes. Just as quickly, the SEALS stowed his gear back in the sled|All at once she understood why this whole day she'd felt even more consumed by Daniel than usual, and also even more conflicted about Cam. She'd dreamed about them both last night.

She'd been wandering through a dusty fog, someone holding her hand. She'd turned, thinking it would be Daniel|he yelled, throwing the barrel onto the bench top as Frobisher continued to shake her head furiously, her eyes wide with horror.
Peterson released the gag and, as Frobisher coughed and spluttered, he undid her wrists and legs.
“Wally!” screamed Frobisher. “Wipe your hand on that towel! Now! Before it soaks into your wounds.”
Peterson frowned at her and picked up the towel|“Aye.”
“And what are you looking at?”
“Molly. She’s a bee but she’s dead.”
“Well, that is very sad. May I look as well?”
“Aye.” Shelly extended the glass to her.
To Miss Currivard’s great credit, she too sank to her knees, took the glass and examined the bee|He does not ask for money or even any help, and his uncle does not offer. Brian wasn't expecting him to. He knows this is something he has to go through alone to prove something to himself. And to his uncle.

His uncle nods. There's a glimmer of respect in his eyes. Respect Brian doesn't often see.

"Good luck in clearing your name, Brian|"I realize it's probably not a good idea to have this conversation over the phone."

"We'll talk later," she said, but Chase was afraid that might be too late.

"I didn't want this misunderstanding to ruin what we have."

"And what do we have, Chase|After a few seconds, I see my mother come into my view, falling to her knees beside the person just sitting up. It's my father. I squeeze my eyes shut over my tears when I see him wrap one arm around her shoulders and lean into her.

But then an even more painful realization slices through me. Jake went back in.

To get Shane.

He's risking his life for a man like Shane|she asked him.

"They will not let me continue matching the nibbler pups with their parents. They say it is too dangerous. That all of the nibblers must be brought to the palace now," said Hazard.

"They will be safer here," said Luxa.

"Yes, now that the diggers can be heard tunneling toward the arena," said Hazard|Her brother would probably rip my eyeballs out and shove them down my throat if he knew. Something told me he wouldn't find out. That she wouldn't tell anyone. Not that she could keep a secret.

She was so free with words, always saying what was on her mind, whether it was appropriate or not. I especially loved it when it wasn't appropriate|It didn't stop me from wishing I could be as impervious to it as my companions, though. Vampires and ghouls might not like the cold, but I was the only one whose teeth were chattering.

"All right, luv?"

Bones asked it while not taking his gaze off the trees in front of him. We were dead center in front of the house, and hopefully that wasn't prophetic|Dad's trashed your room, but they haven't found any drugs yet. And they didn't find any in your locker, and I'm guessing they didn't find any in the car, or I would've heard about it. So right now, it's all okay."

"I'm telling you, there aren't any drugs|Ella moved in front of him and, after a quick glance up the road, sprinted through the gate and onto the lawn, avoiding the gravel pathway and heading towards the house. They ran under the windows along the side of the building until they came to the back porch. Ella chanced a look around the corner at the kitchen door.
The door is open, I don't hear anything though.
Oisin answered instantly. Either do I, we must move, they're close|“Ah, it’s called reading.  Ever try it?” Amber snickered.
On Thursday afternoon, Amber got a call from Peggy.  “Hey Amber.  I’m about ten minutes away.  Do you guys want to meet me in the parking lot?”  Darren and Amber didn’t have a car so they had made plans to ride with Peggy|Gran said a short blessing and everyone dug in. I couldn't help but notice the apprising looks she was giving Cole and I. Was Gran trying to set me up with Cole? No. She couldn't be. She loved Sam, and I knew it. I saw it in her aura. Yet, there was love in her aura too every time she looked at Cole|My focus wasn't as ironclad as I'd always believed.

Let's just say I'm going to need another Guinness the instant I step foot on U.S. soil again.

Poor Henry. The days where his infectious smile and shrug could fix just about any problem were over ... and what was I doing thinking Poor Henry? If that wasn't the last time I put those two words together, I would wrap a rubber band around my wrist and snap it each time I even thought about pairing Henry's name with the word poor|She held it away from him.
“Don’t be an idiot,” she said.
Rackenfauz cocked the rifle with authority. 
“Okay Colonel,” he said, “we’re out of here – now!”
Reyes fixed the old professor with a steely glower. 
“You’ll never get away with this, Rackenfauz|It’s nothing more than a faceless, formless brown blob to me but I take his word of the resemblance to our genetic makeup. 
The vial’s emerald contents are carefully tipped into the dish. A second later, the combined liquids have become a mass that is both liquid and gaseous and rapidly expanding. I see it creeping slowly, a writhing cloud of teal the size of a person now|She thanked Matt, hung up the phone and decided to cook.  That would sooth her nerves.  Derek was fine.  He could take care of himself, she continued to tell herself.  He would call her.
Amber gathered supplies and ingredients and began making lasagna from scratch.  After an hour she forgot about the note that sent her tearing home and lost herself in the cooking|* * *

KELLY WAS SEATED on one of the beds, her back to Diane. She closed her eyes against the pain inside her and slowly?slowly?slowly?

* * *

She WAS WALKING along the Left Bank with Mark, chatting about everything and nothing. Kelly felt that she had never been so completely comfortable with anyone before.

She said to Mark, "Tomorrow evening there's a gallery opening if you're interested in-" "Oh, I'm sorry, Kelly|“Well, I figured that we would eventually be living there full time so, you need to feel comfortable there. You’ve handled getting up close and personal with the horses so, I know they won’t be a problem to you.”
Reaching for the menu he continued speaking. “I’ll teach you to ride as soon as we get the horses settled, you’ll love it,” he finished happily, satisfaction oozing out of him as he reached for the menu|“Carlos Rafael Wilson.”
The man smiled at him. Carlos didn’t have a clue what was going on. He looked to his manager.
“Tom here’s just moved into the house at the bottom of the hill.”
“Oh right.”
“About two, maybe three, miles away,” Tom said and smiled at Carlos|"You can tell Mum's not going anywhere-it took her five minutes just to remember where he was!"

Alice nodded, well used to their eccentricities.

"Here we are!" Flora planted them in the middle of a group of tanned, tawny-haired woman. "Everyone, this is my sister, Alice|If you're too chicken to sleep on my couch I'm sure you can sleep on Ethan's."

"I'm way too old to sleep on anyone's couch," Claire said. "I'll see you guys around." She headed for her car, but Jamie took her arm and pulled her to a halt.

"Claire. Have dinner with me - I'm celebrating tonight and so is Ethan|"You deserve to die."

Sydney gasped at the words. "Slade, you don't even know what you're saying!" She remembered Gunner shoving her to the ground. The bullet that had hit the side of the jeep. Only...hadn't she heard two shots then? Two shots, but only one bullet had gone into the jeep|He immediately blocked Sean's attempt to invade his mind, but it took all of his concentration. For a mortal, Sean's psychic power was incredibly strong.

"You're not getting in, Whelan," Carlos gritted out.

"Dad, leave him alone," Shanna muttered.

Sean dropped the mind probe but continued to glare at Carlos|And then Admiral Atgard saw what Ryan had seen, what he himself had seen before: the tiny flicker of Le Jaunte’s eyes, a flicker he had all but dismissed but that Ryan evidently took very seriously.
“Did you see that?” asked Ryan softly, pausing the tape. “Were you watching his eyes?”
“I was,” replied the Admiral. “What did you see?”
With some effort, Ryan tore his gaze from the screen to look at the Admiral|Now she was standing tall and haughty, supported by a scaffolding of pride.

'Oh, yes, sir, 'cos of when the other side are yelling, "We're gonna cut yer tonk- yer tongue off,"' Shawn blushed and corrected himself, 'and things like that...'

'Yes?'

'Well, you can tell if they're going to be right,' said Shawn|Monique looked at the water, and then at Atlas, “I said ankle deep water.”
“The fish need water to swim around in; this is just above your knees.”
Monique set her shirt by the towels and took the goggles following behind Atlas. “I hope you know CPR in case I drown|Bath pools are huge, big enough for ninety-nine peeps, and they’re always open. You go whenever you want after your work is all done, stay till nesk meal if you want. NOY guards still watch you, but they call themselves “lifesavers.” I don’t get that—they’re just guards|Gabriel asked into the spell of silence which followed.
“Who else, what?” asked Heather.
“Who else wrote in English as their second language. And caught attention.”
“Isak Dinesen,” said Heather.
“Anaïs Nin,” said Flannery.
They both looked for others.
“That’s only two,” said Gabriel|I wanted to make sure you were still comfortable with the arrangements. I can always do something different."

"You're too good to me, Max. But I'm fine. I promise. I'm going to be okay this time. I've learned from my past mistakes. I don't want to make them again|For a certain period of time, I was still reserving room for the hope that Vivienne would walk in, unharmed and perfectly alright. There were times when I fooled myself into believing that her footsteps were gracing the hardwood floors. At some point, however, denial gave way to reality and inevitably, to anger. Someone is to blame for what happened to Vivienne|He was small, even for a dwarf, and his poor taste in sorcerous robes contrasted awkwardly with D’jebee’s elegant attire; her long, diaphanous gown and his chemical-stained, star-spangled robe clashed almost as much as her vacuous expression alongside his own visage, alive as it was with cunning and a twisted intelligence.

D’jebee sighed with boredom.

‘What is it, my love?’ Poldanyelz oozed with ersatz concern.

‘I’m bored,’ D’jebee complained undiplomatically. ‘No one ever comes here. I never see anyone except you.’

A shuffling from the main arch alerted her to the inaccuracy of her statement|I found a book about Napoleon’s life in our local library. One of the chapters described how he had visited a garden while traveling through Italy. He went into the maze garden and couldn’t find his way out. His entourage went into the garden to retrieve him. Isn’t that incredible? A superb military general, who had conquered most of the West at the time, got lost in a garden|Members of the audience could be forgiven for thinking that a lone man sitting cross legged and smoking on stage with others in front of him singing curious songs looked a bit like a hippie.
Then the show got under way. Sycko happily retired from the stage and Master Jeremiah entered to a rapturous applause looking resplendent in his frock and sacred top hat.
“Ladies and gentlemen, Dryvellers, dear guests,” Jeremiah said. It is the greatest pleasure to have you all here with us tonight and I’m sure you’re going to have a wonderful time, in every sense of the word wonderful|"She's a meddlesome, interfering brat," Bowen said in amusement. "But 'tis the truth we love her dearly and life would not be the same without her antics."

Genevieve grinned. "Isn't that the way with little sisters?"

Bowen rose and held out his hand to Genevieve|I sat at the back, let down a kneeler, and slid down on it.

I was hoping to bring order to chaos.

I'd promised Martin to stay with him, when we married. I loved him.

But he was - a Bad Guy. Or, at the very least, a Not-So-Good Guy|In addition to other Karou-related favors Esther had performed for Brimstone over the years-enrolling her in schools, faking identity documents for her, etcetera-she'd been instrumental in setting up her many bank accounts, and surely knew Karou's net worth better than Karou did herself. "Lesson one: We don't worry about how our fruit sculptures are built. We just eat them."

"I won't have to learn, actually," said Karou|We hustled to the left, awkwardly stumbling like a three-legged racer, Gil swinging the flashlight towards the pair of snakes that were now both slithering towards us.
“Up on the bleachers,” I said. “Climb up!”
“No, wait!” We skidded to a halt, two more rattlesnakes slipping from beneath the edge of the bleachers|“Quick, everyone, look for the poster for Cats! I wanna see Cats!” said Khalil.
“I don’t think that’s playing anymore,” said Dwight, trying to get a look at the scenery while Khalil hogged the window.
“Whaaaaaaaat? I finally get to New York, and there’s no Cats|They had not watched him pass through the check-in desks or passport control, so had only assumed that he had caught the flight to Moscow. But there was no record of him arriving at Moscow’s Domodedovo Airport, or for that matter, at any of the others which served the City. 
They were the facts. Makienko could be anywhere. Still in London perhaps, or anywhere else. The only certainty was that he was not in Moscow|Amber got out of the car and met Olivia half way down the walk.  The girls hugged and climbed back into the car.
Amber drove to Charlie’s Place and the girls ordered their favorites from times past.
“Wow, this really takes me back,” Olivia said.
“Yeah, I know,” replied Amber|“Detective Reiss was the detective in charge of the case,” said Greg, “He has been a detective for over twenty years.  Why would he make such a rookie mistake of touching the body without gloves?  He had to have known that such a move would make any DNA evidence found inadmissible in court.”
“We all make mistakes sometimes,” said Jackie.
“I don’t think so,” said Greg|I went down the stairwell, but the smoke was too thick, so I went back up and into the far office where I must have finally passed out. What is your name?”
“Gabriel.”
“Just like the angel,” she smiles. “Thank you for getting me out of there, Gabriel|It had many unusual qualities which may or may not become apparent soon, but currently there was only one that set it apart from any other brassbound chest. It was snoring, with a sound like someone very slowly sawing a log.

The Luggage might be magical. It might be terrible. But in its enigmatic soul it was kin to every other piece of luggage throughout the multiverse, and preferred to spend its winters hibernating on top of a wardrobe|Their food came out then.  Hot, covered dishes were placed before them, Robert first and then Sarah.  The waiter removed the covers from the dishes, wished them both ‘Bon Appetit’ and left again. They ate in comfortable silence, occasionally taking sips of the delectable wine.
“There’s something to be said for fine dining, isn’t there, Sarah|Mum is staring at him in shock, and Dad is grinning. I look back at Bing.

"What?" my brother snaps.

"Nothing," I reply, turning to my dinner.

"You're lying."

"Why would I be lying?"

"What is it?"

"It was just a kind of random outburst, even for you, Bing|Within five minutes, I'd lost the vampire.

I was alone. In the dark. Underground.

I shivered, then reminded myself why I was there and what was at stake. I looked around for a larger tunnel, feeling my way with my fingers.

"Evra," I called softly. I cleared my throat and this time yelled, "Evra|“For the infected. And the other things. And the black clouds. That's what got us. They hunted us down. It’s the only way to describe it. I wonder if the swarms got the rest of the convoy before they made it back.”
“So you were part of the convoy|They knew that a bunch of bikers showing up in class like that was not a good thing.  I hung just outside the door to listen.
“What do you want,” demanded Vincent.
Tiny moved dangerously close to the professor.  He leaned in letting his bulk intimidate the man.  “I know about you and your lust for young women,” said Tiny|Looking ahead, he squinted through the raindrops at the now indistinct outline of the deck of the freighter.  Her bow and stern were invisible to him, having melted into the darkness and murk of the rain.  Small, portable lanterns, likely having been set out by the crew when they docked the ship, lighted her deck, however.  LePage stared for a span of more than thirty seconds and saw no movement in the spare light of the over-matched lanterns|Isn’t it a most excellent law, my dear Sycko? Just imagine! How could we live together if we were allowed to tell lies? But again the Lord in His wisdom has provided.”
“But I may lie if I’m protecting Dryvellism? Wasn’t that a bit like the weeping Diana?”
“I’m glad you mention it, Sycko|I told him we thought highly of his plays and still put them on the boards. In fact, I said we thought they were the greatest pieces of literature in the English language, maybe in any language."

"Good. Good," said Robertson breathlessly.

"I said people had written volumes of commentaries on his plays|My heart was still racing. "And what's this?" I pointed toward the gold bracelet. It had three big rubies on it. It was really ugly.

He nodded, knowing he couldn't lie to me. "Yeah, I've been following you. And that will protect you," he gestured toward the bracelet|The rise of the Orchid Districts and the Immari master plan. David took it in. It was truly a nightmare scenario.

"They bring the survivors here," David said. "What do they do with them?"

"They separate the strong from the weak."

"What do they do with the weak|Gotta run."

DECK HAS A CLIENT in his office when I return. She's a middle-aged woman, heavyset, nicely dressed. He waves at me as I walk by his door. He introduces me to Mrs. Madge Dresser, who wants- a divorce. She's been crying, and as I lean on the desk next to Deck he slides me a note on a legal pad: "She has money|You and JT were-" He broke off when someone shouted his name from topside, the word echoing along the stone tunnel that led down to the sacred chamber.

"What?" he bellowed back, setting up a reverb that made Natalie wince.

"We could use you up here," Aaron called.

Natalie breathed a sigh of relief at the interruption. There was no point in talking about her and JT|"I'm so excited to take both you girls with me," he said, glancing in the rear view mirror at Helen who sat in the back seat in her suede fringed outfit.  "You do look authentic!  A real frontier character," he said with pride.
"With a lot of safety pins," added Helen|Luther pulled out his own medical kit and wiped the area around her hip with more antiseptic before applying a topical antibiotic. "We realized it isn't necessary for the woman to be attracted to the man-only that the man wants her."

Briony frowned. "That's ridiculous. Why would she ever agree to have someone's baby if she isn't attracted|It wasn’t beer—she wasn’t sure what it was. It had a strange, spicy flavor she couldn’t quite place. Was it mead? Some kind of cider? She took another sip. “I’m Sabrina.” It seemed suddenly important that they should know that.
The three strangers nodded. “We don’t use names much here,” said the girl, “but I’m pleased to meet you, Sabrina|Now we will descend down the ancient staircase into the interior, where we will find King Pacal’s tomb. What we will see there are original artifacts. Please be careful of what you touch.” 
Turning on a flashlight, he led the twins down the stairwell which was comparable to a diagonal tunnel. Crouching low, the adventurers moved slowly toward the tomb|“You have proven yourself worthy,” she tells me. She steps forward. I step back. Her smile trembles.
I say, “You turned away from me.”
“Tis my nature,” she says.
“You set your archers on me, and your poisons.”
She shrugs. “I have more archers, and more poisons|He was not at ease, either, but he was always polite. We were both very polite.

It was almost scripted at this point.

"Good morning, Wanda, how did you sleep?"

"Fine, thank you, and you?"

"Fine, thanks. And... Mel?"

"She's good, too, thanks|He had the prettiest girl in town on his arm, asking him to her house. No guy had ever been luckier.

He was so wrapped up in the feel of her against his arm that he didn't notice his dad parked next to his car until it was too late. Wyatt got out of his car and stepped in their path.

"Introduce me to your girlfriend, son," said Wyatt|I read up about Najriadian customs and how the henna party is all about the women dancing and celebrating. There were several mentions of improvisational belly dancing being popular. I thought this would be fun." She looked around and took in the lack of enthusiasm and turned her question to Zhang. "You're not embarrassed, are you, Zhang|So the goodbyes were said and Todd was puzzled even more, he thought to himself (I’ve been surfing the web since the internet was born, why can’t I find this instrument.) 
  The next day the instrument was on Todd's mind again. He decided to search using different search engines. Again another hour was wasted and Todd was frustrated. His wife Kathy called him to the kitchen for dinner, during dinner that’s all Todd talked about, and asked if the family would all get their laptops out after dinner and see if they can help him find some information about the instrument|"I hope it has opened your eyes to the spirit world," Hannah replied, "Not everyone can see the power of the spirits as we do. They are invisible to disbelievers."
Ava responded, "Oh, we saw everything very clearly, didn't we?" she asked Kacey, who agreed, but Ava's intended meaning escaped Hannah. 
"Good. It was nice meeting you. I hope you'll come to my shop again," said Hannah|Whatever was here before must have kept reseeding and growing after the Plague."
"I'll bet that's how most of the animals that survived made it."
"Yeah, until the Infected got them. Or some other wild thing." 
"Do you think it was dogs?"
"I hope so. But you'd think the bones we found earlier would be scattered if it were dogs|She blew across the steaming brew before speaking, “Thanks for doing this with me.”
“Hey, Claire, it’s no problem for me.  We all want to know what happen to José.  How are you holding up?”
“I’m okay.”
Morning traffic was always congested along I-80 West.  John said, “How are the kids, Claire|But to use it to political ends is an outrage. How do you answer to these charges leveled against you, Chaiko of Standing-Rock?” An expectant hush fell over the place, all eyes fixed on the shaman of the Standing-Rock Clan. But he remained composed as if the matter were trivial.
“In the course of a day I do many things, some of which I forget|“No matter the scoff.”
“No matter the scoff.”
“No matter the torment, no matter the pain.”
“No matter the torment, no matter the pain.”
“Taking off this mask will admit that I’m vain.”

Silence. No one said anything, but we all knew how bad it would be if the Reapers ever got their hands on the candle|"Aren't you eager to read it, mother?" Francis asked as he waved his hand in a nonchalant gesture.

Her heart quickened at the thought of what she held. This would be her salvation, and her lips curled into a hideous snarl as she unmasked her true character. "Oh how I've longed for this moment, Francis|He passed the computer without really seeing it and then stopped in his tracks. Robin found Jared through the internet; maybe he could find out something by searching online.
When the search engine popped up, Wayne typed in Jared’s first and last names, hit "enter" and clicked on the first link he saw. It led to a site called Hoping to Find; the boy whose picture appeared on the screen was a younger, shorter-haired version of Jared|Matt leaned closer, staring deep into Selena’s eyes as he asked the question. 
Selena felt the strange tingle in her stomach again as Matt stared at her with such intensity. “Yeah. Sounds great,” she said, her face reddening as Betsy combed her hair. Did we have to discuss dinner in front of Betsy|I held my finger to my lips and stood on my toes to peak through the tiny window set into the metal door. Gregory was pacing and rubbing his hands against his robes as he issued Thorn's orders to six Greenguard standing at attention on the far side of his desk.
"What would be the point of that, Basinger? Each day – each hour they remain – these people consume more and more of our dwindling stores," said Gregory|“Miss Bingley, why don’t you care for the marquis?”
“Again, wrong question. And you’re the famous inspector?” she said, with a half-smile. That smirk! It was driving him mad. “Opinions are formed by events and knowledge. Try again.”
Audley sighed. “What do you know about the marquis|“When he did this, he brought a curse down upon our family and home,” he told me confidentially.
I was confused. “Curse…what you talk about?” I asked him.
He pondered for a moment, apparently not certain if he should continue. Then, he seemed to recall something. “I think a woman is linked to the curse|It will inflict pain and suffering the likes of which you couldn't comprehend. Better that we had all ceased to exist at the hands of the Blade of Shattered Hope."

Now it was Tick's turn to stare back. If she was telling the truth, what did the past matter anyway? What did their terrible history with each other matter|"I'm not doing it, Ares."

"Then we will both die!" Ares said angrily.

"Then we will!" They sat there, both of them stewing for a minute. "So, how do they do it?" asked Gregor.

"You will not like it," said Ares|Charles stepped forward, and once again confronting Varney, with an earnest gaze, he said—

“Do you know, sir, that Miss Bannerworth declares the vampyre she fancies to have visited this chamber to be, in features, the exact counterpart of this portrait?”

“Does she indeed?”

“She does, indeed.”

“And perhaps, then, that accounts for her thinking that I am the vampyre, because I bear a strong resemblance to the portrait.”

“I should not be surprised,” said Charles|And as it briefly moved more into the light, it was revealed to be nervously clutching a rifle.
It was the police officer. Squatting behind the bush, he uneasily peered around it. He was looking towards the minute garden fronting an office block, but set back from the kerb.
At first, Chrissy couldn’t understand his interest in the garden|Mrs McGregor hmmphed to herself and looked at Sacha, a boy she clearly thought needed pyjamas since he was sharing a bed.  Sacha sat quietly, stupefied with tiredness and still pale with shock.  Eventually Mrs McGregor reached in and pulled out a clean rugby shirt that Peter had not worn.  She eyed it to the small boy sitting on the bed in front of her.
“This will do, won’t it, Sacha|"Sure, but I don't know what al this is about." Her breath fogged the air. "I realize now you could have taken my purse away while we were in the SUV. Why go through al this if al you want is the phone?"

"Because I want more than the phone|“I don’t believe you guys,” she shouted hopelessly and stormed off to a hut to change. Only Hendricks who had his hand over his eyes didn’t watch her go.
“A thing of beauty indeed,” commented Bob.
“Shut up,” commanded Chase looking back at him.
“So we have been captured by the great Chase Darkstaar, how interesting,” said Bob|Drake nodded as he sat forward and rested his elbows on his knees. "I guess she gets lonely sometimes, not having a sibling to play with?"

"You've got that right," Meg said emphatically. "She keeps pestering me for a little brother or sister. I don't know why because she's now old enough to know it takes a mommy and a daddy to make a baby..." Her voice trailed off and her heart did a skip as she stared at Drake|Women who used wit to keep men at a distance usually had a sharp edge to them, but somehow with her, it came across as almost ... well, charming and good-natured. Maybe it was the accent. The way she sang her words, she could probably talk a cat into swimming across the river.

No, he corrected himself, it wasn't just the accent|“It’s your choice, my boy. Purged now or the sinner’s fire for eternity. Which shall it be?”
Ernie didn’t answer.
“Which shall it be, Ernie?”
Still no answer.
“Ernie?”
“Purged now.”
“I can’t hear you, Ernie|Suddenly, he turned his horse again and rode back up to Raleigh, who was just mounting up, and called out.
“Raleigh, we are losing the melee!  They are outflanking us on both sides.  The center is too far advanced and looks like it is going to break any second!”
Raleigh thrust his helmet on and lifted up the visor|Jordan and Joel crossed the gangplank, Jordan with a lot less apprehension than the day before, though still not quite with the same confidence as Joel.
As they walked across Light’s deck toward the bridge, Jordan sidled up to Joel. “Do you think Anne will do as you asked?”
Joel looked at Jordan out the corner of his eye. “How would you know what I said to Anne|Still unable to look away from Diana's eyes, Cassie whispered, "Faye."

"What? "cried Laurel.

"Faye," Cassie said, too loudly. She was clutching the piece of hematite in her pocket. Coldness from it seemed to seep through her body. "I said Faye, all right?" she said to Melanie, but she was still looking at Diana|Was Natasha annoyed with Axel? Amused? Merely being factual? It was impossible to guess. Tone of voice, inflection, the subtle melody and rhythm of ordinary speech: all of these were missing. The voice-synth was like a piano that could play only one note.
 	“I neglected to tell you Natasha was coming,” I said to Axel|As I took a seat beside Wolfe on the bed I realised how much older Kir looked than Wolfe, despite them being of the same age. It was almost as if Kir had seen too much; whatever he had gone through had made a physical impression on him.

"Who do you think set the rookery up, Wolfe|Edtroka’s grasp, while not as tight or restricting as Tzanlomne’s, was just as unbreakable. He kept hold of her arm and began leading her through the crowd towards the compound doors.
“Even if you were up for sale, he would not have you,” Edtroka told her with a wicked grin. “I would be in front of him in the queue|I pulled up the hood of my black raincoat and tucked my messenger bag beneath it.

Despite the gathering storm, the grounds of Evernight still weren't completely dark. Nothing less than total darkness would do. Evernight Academy's teachers could see in the night and hear through the wind. All vampires could.

Of course, at Evernight, the teachers weren't the only vampires|I mean, one day she is telling me she loves you, and then the next thing I know, you two are broken up and she's dating Jason. Just don't seem right. Amanda isn't fickle."

Why hadn't she told him? Was she protecting me, or was she protecting her pride? I wanted to believe it was me she was protecting|“They’re not going to need the explosives.”
“What’s the latest news Moro?” Baldazzi put down the gun he was polishing. “Please tell me the Anzio force is inching closer to the city.”
“There’s good news and bad news,” replied Moro. “What do you want to hear first|“I’m so awful with words,” he stumbled, “always putting my foot in my mouth!”
Eloisa smiled. “Don’t worry about that. Just say what you came here to say.”
“I came here because . . . I need to tell you one more time, just one more time, that I want you in my life.”
“But you're marrying Jacqueline,” growled Eloisa|“No,” they say. “Not while you owe on the house in Duluth.”
The house in Duluth hasn’t sold, and we're several months behind on the mortgage.
“What if we get up to date on our payments?” Scott asks.
“That would be a good thing to do, but you still won't be approved for a new mortgage|Jay thought for a minute
and then added, “What about that birth stuff?”
“Birth stuff?”
“Yeah, you know, where you go to the hospital and they
show ya videos and teach ya how to get ready for the baby
and all that?”
“Gees, I don’t know. At this point, you know more about
what goes on than I do, Jay|Trantor, the political center of the Galaxy, had died decades, perhaps centuries before, and was only now obviously falling to rot. While Hari's brief personal flame of self would flicker out long before the Empire's embers powdered to ash, through the equations of the Project he could see clearly the rigor of morbidity, the stiffening face of the Empire's corpse.

This awful vision had made him perversely famous, and his theories known throughout Trantor, and in many parts of the Galaxy|‘Things are vanishing.’ And I saw what she meant and, yes, I was worried then as well. I’m worried now.”
Jones looked over at the jury and was pleased with what he saw: all taken in by Bill Black’s lament.
“No further questions, your honor,” said Jones|“To surprises,” I echo and take a tiny sip. “Blah, I don’t think I’m going to get used to this stuff.”
“What do you think?” Sam asks me. “About the werewolves?”
“I… I really don’t know. Kelly has helped me twice and that comment by James does suggest that vampires don’t like werewolves|The twins decided to go out into the neighborhood to try their new invention outside of the lab. 
A black unmarked car wound its way around the sleepy suburb where the twins were experimenting with their gizmos. 
“Invisible!” commanded each sibling. 
The gizmos dutifully responded and concealed the twins from the rest of the world. Just seconds after, the stealthy government issued-car hummed its engine, passing unaware a few feet away from the twins|We'd just wake up and have TV marathons until we passed out.

Neither of us was getting much sleep, but we were closer than ever. It took a few days for her to start laughing again, but I'd catch her texting on her phone and smiling. It didn't take a genius to figure out who she was texting|During the night banquet, Sagard inquired of Buliwyf his mission and the reasons for his travels, and Buliwyf reported of the supplication of Wulfgar. Herger translated all for me, although in truth I had spent sufficient time among these heathens to learn a word or two in their tongue. Here is the meaning of the conversation of Sagard and Buliwyf|"To the beach with the crystals," said Luxa softly.

Hamnet looked at her in surprise. "You remember that? You could not have been more than two years."

"Just bits and pieces. I still have a chunk of crystal. It is blue," said Luxa.

"And shaped like a fish," said Hamnet|Mü' mü mue 'trilfamees îl'f rfœ Ing-Gland?” Someone was grasping my jacket, jerking me forwards, breathing on me with breath that stank of garlic and chives – someone who didn’t look human… More than one of them. Perhaps they were gnomes or trolls. 
Trogthen. 
Then someone saying - “You are the human|“Tell me something I don’t know.” A hand dropped on a curvy hip. “Look, if you’re trying to flatter me to get me to buy something, it won’t work.”
Jesse shook his head, surprised she hadn’t recognized him. “No, Gabby; it’s me, Jesse|He is far too far away to hear me.
“Captain Yang, I'm the Savior,” I say again, as quietly as I can.
It feels good to say it out loud. It feels like fighting against the secrecy that has kept me locked in my whole life.
“You're the first person I've ever told,” I continue whispering to myself, “but there it is, I'm the Savior|'I sense thy discontent, Anakha,' Xanetia said later when she, Sparhawk and Danae had returned to the fortified roof of the central tower of Ehlana's castle.

'I've been had, Anarae,' he said sourly.

'I do not recognize the expression.'

'He means that he's been duped,' Danae translated, 'and he's being impolite enough to imply that I have too|Why don't you let me give you a ride?"

"I'm good, but thank you." Cadence turned on the car's interior light and pulled out her FBI identification. "Thanks for stopping."

The woman, who had dark-brown hair falling heavily down her back, reached for the ID. She held it a moment, and after a quick scan, handed it back to Cadence|Shes traveling with Casimir and recording his journey, Angus added.

Emma punched some buttons. I think shes having an affair with him.

An image came up on the monitor. A blond, buxom woman was holding a microphone and standing in front of a dark warehouse on a deserted street.

This is Corky Courrant, reporting live on the road with Casimir|Pouring herself a cup of tea, she rang for Parker, who arrived within minutes, carrying her food with him on a tray "Good morning, Miss Emily," he told her with a strained smile.

"Good morning, Parker," she replied. "I'm sorry to point this out to you, but it seems that there's a place missing|“This is a war, boy, and in times like these, there comes a point where a person has to make a choice.” He swiveled, and he and Josh locked eyes. “And that choice is this: Do you want to fight, or do you want to run?”
“I…I don’t know,” muttered Josh|Remember that certain child celebrity who had a penchant for coc**ne and Botox injections? You don't see her at the club scenes anymore, and she's now working in Hollywood again. So I have experience with overgrown children who don't care how their actions affect other people. I have built a career on repairing images of those in the spotlight|We’ll have to stay out of it,” said Tiffany.
“I hope the police get the toads back,” said Yadira, placing her pail on the living room floor.
“Poor things.  Imagine having to live with those people,” said Tiffany.
“And that poor baby,” said Yadira|On the floor, I noticed smal bits of broken glass and two dark stains. Lara and Roderick stood in the middle of the lobby, shouting at each other.

"You assured us this wouldn't happen. You swore that he was completely under your control."

Lara's hands were clenched into fists at her sides as she glared up at Roderick|I realize he knows about the LD following him. I decide to secure the deal with the LD. I blast the loudest whistle I can muster, and then scurry back towards the alley. The plan is for them to chase after me. 
I hear the thumping of one set of feet follow me. I silently pray for a miracle as I run as fast as I can back to the alley|“What do you want to know?” Nadia’s voice was shaky. Her eyes were filling up with tears. She should have listened to Anabella; nothing good ever came from her mischief. 
“How about you leave the questions to me? For instance, tell me about your nephews.” 
“Don’t you talk about my nephews|Dee glanced at the others, then patted Jenny's shoulder. "Okay, Sunshine. You go back to sleep, and later we'll talk about it."

"What, you think I'm joking? I'm not. I'm telling you-we can walk right out of here."

"Uh, Tiger-" Dee looked over her shoulder at the fire, then back at Jenny|There had always been a certain amount of tension between Basha and Jawen, a back-and-forth game of love and lust ever since they were little; she had not recognized it then. But as they got older, it had developed and grown more intense, a ritual of fight or flight between them, chasing each other around and trying to hide, or show, their real feelings.
 “Jawen, be serious.” 
“All right already, I will be serious|Declan slowly walked over, still breathing heavily, and flipped back the intruder’s hood to reveal the culprit. “Jules, what’s going on?” 
“Wait a minute, Declan!” Jules’ eyes were wide-open. “How did you move so quickly to knock me down?” 
“I’ve got lightning speed,” Declan answered dismissively. “Why are you spying on us, Jules|The students moved slowly toward the front, taking seats close to the stage. Monson, Casey, and Artorius made their way down the third aisle from the front and parked themselves next to a large, frumpy-looking boy who smelled of cabbage. The boy turned from the friend with whom he had been talking as they approached. His eyes fell upon Artorius, Casey, and then Monson|"Lucien, don't..."

"Yes, Julienne. Look at me."

Reluctantly she lifted her lids and met his gaze, the austereness of his features stealing her breath.

"I'm so very sorry, sweet. I never wanted to hurt you."

Julienne fought the tears that threatened. "Allow me to explain something to you, Lucien|Fellows didn't bother knocking; he simply had his two burly constables kick the door open. Jeffrey, stirring coals in a rusting kitchen stove, turned on them with the poker.

Jeffrey was fast, beating back the constables with deadly intent. A woman came screeching out of the bedroom in her dressing gown. She didn't bother beseeching them-she grabbed a pan from the stove and threw the hot water in it at the constables|“Don’t anybody move,” he said, loud and clear, looking at each of the workers. One of the men turned to run and a stream of yellow plasma licked out from Bastian’s arm and hit him in the leg. The man yelled in pain and lay on the ground, peeling away strips of melting suit before it burned into his skin. “Probably hard of hearing,” said Bastian to the other workers|'Look!' And Leonardo pointed to the tabletop. The dagger blade, fully restored, had been fitted into the strange mechanism, which in turn was fixed to the bracer. Everything was polished and looked as if it had just been made, but nothing shone. 'A matt finish, I decided,' said Leonardo|“You’re the one that came up with the Hiders and mask-jumping. Remember that next time you worry about someone recognizing a mask, okay?”
Eduard hesitates and makes a sound like he wants to say something. Instead, he sighs and drops his hand, looking at the white brick wall standing behind Becca. He nods eventually and tells her to go get a new mask|Most of the time.

"Aye, Papa. May I kiss Mama good night?"

Ewan smiled. "Of course."

Crispen hurried back over to Mairin and allowed her to sweep him into a hug. She kissed the top of his head and then squeezed him tight. Crispen returned and stood solemnly in front of Ewan|She didn't get that he called her name for the very first time. Until now, he had called her Decima. Julia was sure he mixed up the names without purpose. He was in pain, in fever, he was wounded and therefore confused and excused. However, he noticed the change just in the moment he spoke out her name aloud|The Kaltaures army was relentless; they surrounded the temple and ran through the village burning down everything in sight. 
Only Roland, an elder Lealian, had noticed the advance, which had allowed him the time to bar the temple door. 
“Open the door Lealian or your whole town will burn to the ground,” screamed Abednego the feared leader of the Kaltaures army. 
“We can see it is too late for that, Abednego,” replied Roland|"A food challenge should have been awesome, and instead, we just couldn't keep it down. I know I'm disappointed."

"Annabelle," Chip said, turning to me. "This is your first time up for Judgment. Does that make you one of the strongest players left in the game?"

Internally, I winced. Way to point a bulls-eye on me there, Chip|The first man I really wanted to think me pretty, and—
“When you don’t try so hard,” he finished.
I looked back up. No one had ever said anything like that to me before.
He met my eyes for a few seconds.
The waiter reappeared, a skinny white frame, as straight as a flagpole.
Jonathan drew his hand away and then waited for me to order|You're not fit for visitors yet."

Interpreting the look on Raych's face, Dors quickly added, "I'm an exception because I'm your mother, Raych. Why would you want that woman to see you, anyway? You're in no condition to be seen."

"All the more reason to see her," muttered Raych|‘Why did you take so long to return? Did you find anything? And can you smell that awful smell?’
Jack looked at the burning forest below them; the smoke beginning to engulf them. 
‘I suppose it will burn itself out eventually.’ He said, as they both rose above the level of the smoke|He must have literally meant there were going to be several first clues.”
	Dizzy was depressed. It was 9:45 and they were practically starting over with a new clue. He wondered how many people had gathered as many clues as they could on Main Street and gotten to work immediately. He feared they were already too far behind.
	“Don’t even think it,” Travis said, looking at Dizzy|Overpowering your mind as you can overpower a human's?" 

"Yes, and shielding his presence from me." There was mounting excitement in Stefan's voice. "That's why he hasn't answered my calls. He wanted-" 

"He wanted just what's happened to happen. He wanted you to doubt yourself, to think you were a killer.But it isn't true, Stefan|"Hmm." Her gaze travelled to the other side of the menu. "Too many to choose from."

"What do you think of Bluebelle?" he asked, setting his menu to the side.

"Looking for some utter nonsense for me spout?" she couldn't help but say, and then quickly turned her attention back to the menu|I get closer within better view, but it seems I won't get close enough to throw my spear from here. I take a breath and think range.
Watching the squirrel feast up in the tree with the edge of a branch next to? It seems the squirrel is having more than lunch with that supply. I notice something; it's not just me, and the squirrel|In that instant she knew that Roku had pushed one of his memories into her mind, just as he had done when he and Bastian were trying to convince her to join them in the hunt for Alistair. She had a brief glimpse of flames, of a house consumed by fire, and of a woman kneeling before Roku, trying to comfort him in his rage.
Bastian stood looking down at Haven, frowning. He helped her to her feet, then knelt down next to Roku|The great master insisted that I return to your apartment and retrieve your plants, but did he give a thought to the poor wretch he sent out into the cold and snow? Non." Levet gave a small sniff. "I am no more than a pitiful servant in his eyes."

"Styx sent you to get my plants|Sarah's next call was to Rome's hotel in Los Angeles; he wasn't in, but she hadn't expected him to be at that time of day. She left a message that she was beginning labor and told him which hospital she would be in. As she hung up a tear rolled down her cheek. She so wanted Rome there! But she wiped it away and touched her stomach. "We're on our way," she told her baby|He bolted up when he remembered, but a hand appeared on his chest. A very weary-looking Vikus pressed him back down into the sheets. "Stay, Gregor, or they will have to restrain you."

"What's that mean?" asked Gregor.

"Tie you to the bed," said Vikus|It’s nice to see you again. Traveling far?”
Alyssa pulled her eyes away and glanced at the floor. “Yes,” she answered in a quiet yet annoyed tone. She forced her eyes to rise and focused on placing her items on the counter as he moved aside.
He glanced at the pretty little girl beside her, then back to Alyssa|And the day after that."

My heart thumped convulsively. It had happened. Against my will, despite the na**d girls and the smell of wolf and all of the things that hinted at future misery, I had fallen back in love with Cole.

I said, "Good night, Cole|'People are coming up with new ideas in ship design all the time. Are you going to reach ahead and bring us back a ship that hasn't been invented yet?'

'That's an interesting idea, Khalad, but I wouldn't know where to look. The future hasn't happened yet, so how would I know where - or when - to find that kind of a ship|“Alex,” I said again, this time it came out sounding almost normal. Alex still did not respond. I reached up with my hand and shook him. He let out a groan. At least I knew he was still alive. The truck had hit us on the passenger side totaling it. I was baffled at the fact that he survived|Flagging a cab, I jumped into the backseat. Directions to my apartment were the only thing that stopped me from bursting into tears then and there.

Flinging the money into the front seat I jumped out of the car, the hem of my dress ripping up the back in my haste. Mortification ate at me as I struggled to keep my modesty intact in front of the driver|EBE-2 leads us to a place near another entrance and offers us water, at least we think it is water. Tastes like chemicals but it is water. Actually tastes good. [6]

SUBSEQUENT DAYS ON SERPO
The leader of the Ebens is a larger creature than the others. He seems to be more aggressive than the other Ebens|“I know I talk sense, but if it were common, I don’t think our economy would be in such a mess.”
With that her spot was over. She turned off her microphone, waved through the window at the producer, and slipped out of the booth.
Johnny read the police reports from the Vantage Heights neighborhood for a few quick laughs.
Mitzy didn’t laugh when she thought of Vantage Heights|Most people glanced at her, her stunning presence being so absorbing.  Lorenzo tore his sight away from where she was standing after getting her meal.  Billy waved at her.
“Come sit with us,” he told her.  Lorenzo choked on his enchiladas and had to take a huge gulp of milk.  
“She’s coming over,” whispered Billy|I sat up and looked at him. "Do you want me to go?"

He shook his head. "Nah. Just relax."

"Okay. I think a toothbrush would be nice. Do you want some money? You paid for the room. The lease I can do is buy you a toothbrush|“Give me a hand moving him, will you? I’ll take his shoulders and you can get the feet.”
“Uh, sure,” said Maklavir hesitantly. He glanced over at Jade again. 
She was looking off into the forest. 
Maklavir touched her gently on the shoulder. “You sure you’re all right, Jade|Now, the next item on the agenda - '
Jock McLean burst back in at this point, breathless and indignant.
'It's raining,' he complained at first, and then, in a doom-laden voice, 'and there's a lad from the Council coming down the street.'
'How do you know he's from the Council|Collet motioned to two sealed evidence bags on the desk. "And this?" The man shrugged. "Force of habit. I bag anything peculiar." Collet walked over. Peculiar?

"This Brit's a strange one," the examiner said. "Have a look at this." He sifted through the evidence bags and selected one, handing it to Collet|Frustrated at myself, I moved through the gates, catching sight of three older boys kicking a football against the school wall and talking. I recognized one of them.

Marco.

I didn't know what his surname was because he was in fifth year and I was a third-year. I only knew of him because he was so popular his name had made its way down the years|You certainly weren't trying to channel Brennan's energy, yet you did. It's a subconscious thing for you. You will both have to work hard to overcome it."

"Yes," I agreed, scanning the face of everyone surrounding me. "I know. And I'll do it. We'll both work harder than we've ever worked at anything, won't we, Brennan|Hudson had said it was he that she was mad at, and maybe she was mad at him. But she hated me. It was evident in her entire posture.

A chill ran down my spine as, again, I realized she'd always be there. She'd always be threatening at the periphery of my life with Hudson|I shook my head, opening the gate.

There s no other way, Aislin. Time s up. This is it.

Well, I m waiting here.

She refused to step onto the sidewalk.

That s fine.

I walked for the front steps.

I d rather do this on my own, anyway|Daemon asked.

"No, it just means I'll have to knock you down first."

Yes, he knew that flavor of Lucivar's temper, and he knew the man. Lucivar was primed for a fight-and right now, the opponent didn't much matter.

"Lady," Daemon said, never taking his eyes off Lucivar|The attendants are screaming and looking in every direction for some kind of instruction. But all I can focus on is getting Rhoda to safety. I search for her and see Aden leading her towards me. I step over the crown on the floor and run to them.
“I have to go,” Aden says quickly.
“I know—I’ll take Rhoda|The food was, incidentally, better than it smelled.

She put his salad in another bowl, dressed it and slid it along the counter to where he was eating and watching her.

She was busying herself putting away the food when he remarked, "That must have been rough."

"It happens."

"It does, Abby, that doesn't mean it isn't rough|"Maybe when they get out they'll think twice before getting drunk, or doing drugs, or showing off to their buddies before getting behind the wheel of a car."

Damon walks over to Caleb and gets into his personal space. He doesn't touch him; he just stands there. "You'll be okay, Caleb."

Caleb turns his face away, but as if he can't help the words from coming out against his will he says, "I don't want to go back there, Damon|“I will take you back if you truly wish for it.”
Her breath caught as it so very often did as she met his gaze, the warmth of his expression the liveliness of his eye. “Well,” she mused. “We are halfway to the orchard now. I suppose it will do no harm, but only for a few minutes, mind|“Veronica,” said Charles, in his usual arrogant tone, “I need you to meet me at the Pyrenees restaurant as soon as you possibly can. It’s of the utmost importance.”
“I’m rather busy at the moment,” said Ronni, annoyed at being interrupted in her conversation with Pete and also impatient to get to Gage Park and see her mother.
“I won’t take no for an answer,” said Charles|"In duty, you mean," Isabella said.

He laughed. "Sassenach, if you believed marriage was for duty alone, you'd never have eloped with me in the first place. When you met me you didn't think, Ah, here is a dashing rake. Let me run off with him so I can be dutiful|“Aunt Jenny,” I began, “I recently got hold of a journal. Sarah Smalls’ journal.” 
She brightened up at mention of the name. 
“Sarah Smalls. What on earth are you doing with her journal?” she asked.
I told her about the article I was planning on writing. I didn’t tell her from whom I had gotten the journal|She would make sure he did not come into school today.
Shirley had turned up for work, but was very fragile.
‘Are you sure you want to be here?’ Laura asked.
‘No, I’m not sure of anything, but I wouldn’t be any better at home, would I?  If you can put up with me I’d rather be here,’ answered Shirley|Evalle could count her friends on one hand, and none of them would help Kizira find her.

"Who told you we'd be together?" Tristan asked.

"Vladimir Quinn."

Evalle swung around, slamming her back to the wall. Her heart cramped. Quinn would never betray her. How would he even know she was here with Tristan|Yet Paul looked over at me as though he were grateful for the defense. I realized how close we were sitting-closer than we usually did, so near that my arm nearly brushed against his-but I didn't move away.

Instead I said, "So does destiny create the math, or does math create our destiny?"

"Insufficient data," Paul said, but I could tell, in that moment, how much he wanted to believe in destiny|Scarab asked, when they had all disrobed and settled into the frothy water, earthen goblets of some strange liquor in all their hands, its cooling properties offsetting the almost unbearable heat of the bath. "Have you already finished your work?"

Karou was grateful to Issa for answering. She didn't feel up to faking her way through any normal social interaction.

Where is he?

"The gleaning is done," said Issa|Gardner Paleston called her every evening and talked to her for an hour. She had more potential than any other student he'd ever had, he said.

"I want to teach you all I know, Rose," he said. "I've never felt that way about anyone before. I want to give you all that I can, do you understand what I'm saying, Rose|Anyway, I thought it would be a good test of its strength if J.D. held it the proper way and I took a swing at it with the little mace I had on my belt. We had already finished crossing the river and we were about half a day from our base camp when I finally convinced him we should test it.
He held the shield and I took out my mace|The double deuces slipped into gear and followed Riley's Humvee as it turned onto the taxiway, then the main runway.

"Step on it, Jack!" Smith said as he watched the shuttle reach the ramp that descended into the bunker.

Riley obliged. Gunning the deuce, he pulled up to the ramp just as the shuttle disappeared.

"Jon!"

But Smith had already jumped out and was running into the bunker|I think my family's figured out which world I ran away to and they're probably coming to get me.  But I don't want to go!  I like being out on my own.  There are more than enough of us to bring the storms."
"Dragon!"  Leah exclaimed.  "You're-you're a dragon|She looked at Garrett and remembered the face of a small boy standing next to his mother in the family photo at his sister’s house. “How’s the weather?” she said with a slight smile, hoping he would remember their conversation from the park. Then she turned to Hardy and apologized for following him. “You have to know I wouldn’t give up on you, Hardy|It had sharp claws for rending and tearing. One eye was wide open and staring at them through the thick wall of ice.

Joie let her breath out slowly. "That's no dinosaur."

"It has to be," Gabrielle said. "It can't be a dragon. Don't tell me it's a dragon|"What's going on?" Bonnie asked, sitting down, wiping at her eyes again. Fallen rose petals dotted the bench, and she flicked some of them off. A soft rumble of thunder came from far away.

Zander dropped to his knees in the dirt at her feet. "I don't want to break up with you, Bonnie|Jia steered the carriage up into the hills and they finally arrived at a ridge overlooking a valley. This valley was filled with thousands of mulberry trees. They stretched across the valley and down as far as the eye could see. Workers moved amongst the trees with large sacks into which they placed the mulberry leaves that they had picked.
    “Food for the most treasured object in our province – the silkworm,” announced Jia|I couldn’t prevent myself from opening the third doll. As I twisted it ajar, I imagined that I could hear Alexander crying out in pain. This particular doll didn’t open quite so easily. I pulled with all my might, until it finally gave way, popping as it divulged its secrets. A strange sight greeted me as I viewed the interior of the doll|That this could very well be the end of the trail, and there was no Cassie here. He couldn't concentrate on that thought, he would snap if he did. There was something off about this place, something not right at all, and he had to stay focused on that. He had to keep hold of the hope that whatever was wrong here would somehow lead him to Cassie|Jackie looked at the other woman, studying her, looking for the family resemblance in the woman who was apparently her half sister.

Helen's brown hair was braided, with each of her twin braids falling forward over her shoulders. Her face was sweetly rounded, which seemed at odds with the power the woman wielded.

Jackie had seen firsthand what that woman could do with magical fire.

"I was just going down to the dining hall for some food," said Jackie|It was changing color again, the green bleeding into blue. He replaced it. Neither of us mentioned the change. 
“So a girl has to be easy for you to date her?” I asked. 
Foster grinned. “No, she just has to kiss. A kiss says a lot about a person. You can tell a great deal about the way they are just from the way they kiss|******

The following morning about eleven o'clock d'Angelay walked quickly into my room and shut the door. I saw immediately from his manner that something was wrong.
“Monsieur,” he said, “we must be very quick now. The Boche are here and they are searching the whole hospital.”
“Hellfire!” I exclaimed. “Where do you want me to hide|Todd replied: No I thought you looked familiar but I can’t recall.                                                                    The stranger told Todd: I’m Enoch; we met in your dream. Todd looked back again, this time he realized it really was Enoch; Todd stopped on the side of the road, leaned back and tried to see if he was dreaming.                                                                  When Enoch said: No Todd you’re not dreaming|“Sure.” Sara and Victoria both nodded.
“So what about me? Am I not trusted to bake a cake or what?” The three girls turned their heads and looked at Benjamin with surprise.
“Well, can you bake?”
“Can I bake? Are you really asking me if I can bake|At least he wasn't one of those "on the make" guys who kept one in his wallet "just in case."

"Hang on, let me go see if I can find one."

Ace let her up.

Rhea raced to the bathroom and started looking through her drawers.

"Come on," she said under her breath as she searched|“If there was a tracking device in the chopper, they’ll know where we crashed.”
“I bet they know anyway,” said Marius. “It was remote control that shut down the chopper. There was nothing Marius could do.”
“They cut the engine from way back at the Dome?” asked Haven.
“Is the only possibility,” said Marius|"Sorry about the heat," she said. "My AC went out two weeks ago, and I just haven't been around to replace it." Sheaves of paper had been spread across the coffee table, the sofa, in numerous piles on the floor. Devlin counted three bulletin boards in the living room alone|Zoe’s mother seemed to like him well, so he thought that his chances were pretty good.
Zoe was waiting for him outside her apartment building when he arrived. He smiled broadly when he saw her. This was the first time that she had greeted him before he walked up to her second-floor home.
“Let’s go to the beach. I want to talk to you,” said Zoe|"And that's bad?"
"Yes. You want to know that you're giving money to good people, after all. That's what your board does." She put that stack of mail to the side and moved on to the next. "This pile is invitations." It was, by far, the largest pile|As I looked at Hailey's album, I could tell that her arrival had been a blessed occasion.  I could see I was older in the picture, and I looked confident.  In some of the preceding pictures, I saw Doug with who must have been a very pregnant Cami at the hospital.  Doug looked like a proud uncle.  Everyone appeared truly pleased and upbeat at the arrival of Hailey|‘Oh yes, dear,’ Nell replied. ‘I’ve seen it all before. Coal.’
Mary pulled Nell away. ‘Nell, the Federation is bringing more and more into the dispute. Why, every time there’s a meeting we learn the Federation has done this or that.’
‘It’s the right time to do it,’ said Nell|Carlos's tanned face took on a reddish hue. "No, sir."

Caitlyn felt her own cheeks warm with a blush. Angus knows.

"We've added more security measures at the townhouse," Angus continued. "Phineas and Carlos, I'd like for ye to move back there. We doona need one of our guards here if all the Vamps do their death-sleeping at the townhouse|Helping Elisabeth wasn't only the right thing to do; it was also important to Fabian. Really, what other choice did I have?

Cool fingers curled around my hand, squeezing once. I looked away from Fabian to meet Bones's steady gaze.

"You're not the only one who feels indebted to him," Bones said quietly. Then his mouth curled as he focused on Fabian|Then he looked up at me and spoke with difficulty, as if he were confessing to me.
“Nathan, I’ve been a bit rough on you.  It was only out of concern for my sister.”
“I realize that.  I’d be protective too.”
“Yeah, well, maybe I was too protective|Cap steps into the elevator and presses the button for the twentieth floor. “Well, I suppose you can walk me home,” he says. He grabs the bars behind him for support. I stand next to him and lean against the wall behind me.

“Can I ask you a question, Cap|Back up is on the way.

Niccolo felt his stomach knot. Inferno! More were indeed coming. He was in no shape to fight. On the other hand, the message said he still had an army. Very confusing. "Buon. Tell me, who sent this?"

She slid her index finger vertically across the screen to show him the name of the sender|Old Yeller, the ugly hound Alexa convinced Nick to keep more than a year ago, lay in the small patch of sun leaking through the window and watched the puppy with an air of disapproval. The familiar blue and orange Mets bandanna wrapped around his neck gave off a distinguished appearance unheard of for a once mangy stray.

Maggie tried to avoid the subject. "I can't believe you got a puppy|I returned to swimming wondering what I'd done to obviously offend him but with bigger things to think about. Ten laps later, I was ready to begin my day.

I climbed out of the pool and looked up to see Tristan standing on the deck next to the chair where I'd left my things. Dressed in a suit, he didn't look like he was there to swim|Vaxili moved towards him but Izebol waved him away with an abrupt gesture that stopped Vaxili short as if he had been struck in the face. He turned on his heel and stalked down the steps to take up a position in front of the first rank.
Izebol raised his arms and waited for silence. Then he called out, ‘Zabrazal grieves when his people grieve.’ Izebol paused, looked over the assembled company, and then fixed his eyes on Vaxili|His face cleared of expression, almost as if a curtain slammed down, closing out any audience to his soul.

She hadn't reached his inner depths yet, but with time and patience, she would. "I have all the books," she said, accepting his parameters. "That's what's so strange. On the phone, he said he wanted the books|That made a million questions tear through his mind-almost made him stop running. Mistress Jane. He couldn't possibly accept that she was on his side.

"Sato!"

He looked down to see Tick's face in the water, his hand reaching out for him. He was still thrashing as if he might drown|He scowled at Ben and Parkman and then looked questioningly at Paulson.  He had evidently seen the posse bring them in and could not figure out why they were out of the jail.
"Sy let these gents go," Paulson said in answer to the bartender's unspoken question.  "We figured out, us that was in the bank that day, that it wasn't them|Then he turned to Mitzy and kissed her full on the mouth.
Her head spun. Her heart beat like thunder.
She wrapped her arms around him, letting her fingers thread through his thick, black hair. 
Then she pulled away.
He wrapped his arm around her waist. “It doesn’t matter what’s in here, Mitzy|He not only relished the task of ferreting out the provenance of some obscure artwork, but also enjoyed the recognition from her as a quasi authority.
“One of my students mentioned a painting that she viewed while visiting China. I think it was in Suzhou.” She paused.
“Suzhou?” he asked.
“No, no! It was the old city of Suzhou. That’s what she said, the old city|It was an illusion, of course, as most masks a vampire chose to wear were, but it was a face Vikirnoff recognized. Arturo had once been a hunter of the very thing he had become. Vikirnoff could only hope Arturo had recently turned and did not have centuries of wielding evil behind him.

"How many times must we do this, Arturo|“So how do you know about it?” Noah asks. “Because, you see, this isn’t Koolibar Street. Not any more. It’s Ambler Road now, since they changed the name. Renamed it after some local councillor, I think. But that was years ago. Only someone who grew up in Baytown would remember it used to be Koolibar Street|They are a treat where I come from."

He made Madam Octa push a ball across the table, then got her to balance on top of it. He set up small pieces of gym gear, tiny weights and ropes and rings, and put her through her paces. She was able to do all the things a human could, like lift weights above her head and climb ropes and pull herself up on the rings|Ishmael walked up and down to try the new leg and went to find Jonr:
“The new leg!” he declared, turning it this way and that to show the leader.
“Yeah, looks fine. Put some leggings on!”
“Oh sorry. I forget about the clones’ inhibitions!”
“For the last time, we’re not clones|“Get your hands off me,” Rashi protested. “Don't you know who I am? I can't be treated this way.” And he looked at Atalai with pleading eyes. “What have I done, my Mistress, to deserve this?”
“That's what we need to find out, my friend,” said Atalai|"You told her we were having an affair," Ethan said. "That's messed up."

She thinned her lips in a tight smile. "I did what I thought was best and you're going to thank me for it when you see what I found on her computer. She's been lying to you all along, Ethan|"Lissa, will you sit down and talk with me for a bit?" Winkler asked.

There was a nice chair in the corner of the bedroom, so I pulled it over to the end of the bed. I didn't want to feel like I was talking to Winkler across a canyon or something. "What's on your mind, Winkler|Dizzy was just a kid and Justin couldn’t hurt him without significant punishment. Dizzy took a breath to calm down and turned back to the pig.
	“Just solving this clue,” Dizzy said. He held up the phone and took a picture of the pig. Dizzy looked at the gravestone one last time and then turned to Justin|I think I'll take in some air before Tanner comes back for us."

I relayed Mayzie's order to Christina, who had slipped back behind the counter. She whipped it up and slid it over.

"Keep what I said in mind," Mayzie said.

"I'm pretty sure I will," I said.

She giggled merrily, as if we were in cahoots|He must still be enamored with having to endure his sister-in-law’s lack of cleaning capabilities.
“Are there any messages for me?  Room 17?”
Again without looking up or checking who was asking, he said, “Nope.”  Well, it was a small motel.  I guess he would know if there were messages|He lurched to his feet, picked up the nearest object, a shoe, and hurled it at a locker.

"What's that noise?" the person on the other end asked uneasily....

...Stupid, stupid, stupid. You can't lose control...

"Nothing," he said, recovering his flat tone. "A shoe fell out of a locker|Cameron looked between Julian and Zane as Zane moved the hand bracing his gun and slid it into his jacket. He pulled out a leather wallet and tossed it to Julian.

Julian caught it deftly with one hand, then flipped it over to look at the identification within. He stared at it for a moment before looking up at Zane|I cross over to the corner where Aden is lying down with his back facing me.
I climb in my cot and stare at the roof, repeating Aden’s words in my head.
What would life be without you?
Aden’s life would be just as significant without me. I’m the one who would be worse off without him. I wouldn’t be alive at all if it weren’t for Aden|“Oh, just looking around,” she said.
“You’re going to get us kicked out,” said Ronni. And wouldn’t that just round off her day perfectly.
“Well, there aren’t any bathrooms on this floor,” said Donna, stepping through.
“Donna, every room has its own bathroom,” said Ronni|"Erin talked to a reporter," Liz told him. Erin was Brady's ex-girlfriend. They had broken up after he had visited Liz in October.

"What makes you think that? She's not the type to get involved with the press."

"She is the press," Liz reminded him. Erin worked as an anchor for Baltimore Mornings, though it was kind of a stretch in Liz's mind to call her press|Ms. D'Miagmo was that teacher.

Trystan opened his mouth, but Brie cut him off, "Ms. D'Miagmo, I think it's obvious that Trystan feels uncomfortable answering this question because of his religion. Isn't it against school policy to discuss faith issues in the classroom anyway?" She flipped her golden hair over her shoulder and blinked her big blue eyes at the teacher|"Is that…?" Zach asked.
"There's no way Kiyu dropped it twice." I crept closer.
"Not a good idea, Julia."
But he loaded a bolt into his crossbow and covered my careful approach. I was right. The piece of lace was the same one that I had found at the crime scene in the Houses and returned to Kiyu|"I know my limitations; I'm good at building museum-quality model railways that make people gasp with delight and amazement, but I'm not awesome like these other guys."
"Nevertheless, you were chosen," said Gladys. "You are The One."
 Macklin stared at her with rapt attention. "You really think I'm The One?" he said.
"It's as plain as the beak on your face," said Gladys|You know how hypnotized people can get a blister if you tell them that you're touching them with something hot-even if it isn't hot. It's like that."

Michael ran his hands through his hair. "No, but Jenny, it's really hot. You can't even get near it."

"That's because you believe it's hot|“Can you give me your cell phone number?” she said. “I may need to talk to you again.” After Georgina gave her the number, Sam raised her hand to summon Officer Garcia, who had been watching the interview through the windowed door to the office. “I appreciate your speaking with me,” she told Georgina|The choice of the opposing team was to get the ball in the first half. Hardy walked back to the sidelines, scanning the crowd again for any sign of Miracle.

He was getting more and more frustrated the longer he couldn't find her. He saw his family, his father glaring at him warningly. He saw many faces of people he knew, but there was no sign of Miracle|Maximilian watched from a tower and despaired. He could understand Atalai's grief but he could not condone open warfare and decided to try once more to convince her that a peaceful solution could be found.
They met as Atalai was on her way to plan the battle with her generals.
“Could I have a word with you please, Atalai|“I discovered that fact when I took over the listing after Brenda’s death,” Walker said tightly. “How did you find out?”
“I asked Detective Grimaldi if she had a copy of the listing agreement, and she faxed it to me. This morning.” 
Walker’s demeanor was making me nervous, and caused me to start babbling. “See, Alexandra Puckett told me that Brenda had met with someone at Beckett’s Bar to handle the details of the listing|“Anyone who has spent time in a kitchen can tell the difference,” replied Vasquez. “I know your wife does all the cooking just by that comment.  I’d be surprised if you could boil an egg.”
“People boil eggs,” said Timms with a chuckle.
“Get that child some food, before I prove that you can’t even make a bed,” said Vasquez|‘I have noticed that there is something different about you, you are always humming to yourself, you are more absent minded than usual, yet you seem to have loads of confidence, what’s up?’
Louie went a little bashful and explained to Pearl about Lulu. 
‘Louie that is just wonderful for you’, Pearl responded. ‘You really are a dark horse, you loveable bee. I am just so happy for you and Lulu|Andre brought her hands to his lips and brushed them with kisses. "I hate to see you so blue, mon tresor."

That rated a genuine smile from Tasha. "You know, I never knew I wanted a child until I found myself knocked up with one." She let out a half-laugh and made eye contact with Andre|A little shaken, I continued toward the lighthouse, which now loomed larger, almost heavy, its black-and-white stripes topped with red making it somehow authoritarian. I would have no further shelter before I reached my destination. I would stand out to whoever or whatever watched from that vantage as something unnatural in that landscape, something that was foreign. Perhaps even a threat.

* * *

It was almost noon by the time I reached the lighthouse|Dixon sighed heavily, muttered a ripe epithet under his breath and told himself to get to work. But the hardest work that lay ahead, he realized then, didn't involve Sorcerer at all. Because it wasn't Sorcerer's trust Dixon was worried about.

AVERY RETURNED TO HER ROOM after dinner feeling more foolish than she had ever felt in her life. Which was saying something, since there had been innumerable times in her life when she'd felt foolish|Chris’s voice had come from Paige’s left.
An electric buzzing sound cycling between highs and lows came from the same direction.  
Paige took a couple more steps down into the pit.  A dim orange candle flickered in a far corner casting a weak halo of light on what looked like a small desk.  She couldn’t make out much else in the room, and she couldn’t see Chris|He had done several jobs for Alcander and had been strung along with very little in return.
"Let's talk," said Alcander. The glass of the window was of exceptionally poor quality and Alcander stooped to peer through the opened half of the window. He gritted his teeth against the discomfort in his lower back.
"Tell me about the activity since he moved," said Alcander|'As far as we can understand it, he's creating a new home for wizardry'

Streamers of coloured light flashed about the indistinct ovoid, like a distant thunderstorm. The glow lit Coin's preoccupied face from below, giving it the semblance of a mask.

'I don't see how we will all fit in,' the bursar said. 'Carding, last night I saw-'

'It is finished,' said Coin|Liam took the mug from my hand and sipped it. "Nice."

"Get your own."

He grinned. "Why? Never learned to share?"

I pulled my mug back from him, nearly burning us both in the process.

"Okay, I forgot. I shouldn't try to come between you and coffee|The Hathaway girl?"

"Rose?" she asked in astonishment. "Why do you - ? Yes, of course. I'll get her."

Lissa hurried toward guest housing, but I met her halfway. "What's going on?" I asked.

"I have no idea," said Lissa|“It just gets weirder, doesn’t it?” asked Julianna.
“It certainly seems to,” Dr. Hendricks agreed. “Now what do we propose we do?”
“It’s getting late, I think we should find a hotel and then some dinner,” proposed Milk.
“Sounds like a fine idea,” agreed Julianna|They’d never seen anyone like you. But I had. I realized I hadn’t imagined it. Ty did have a tail.”
“Was that his name? Ty?” The sandwich wasn’t going down easy and Sara took a sip of lemonade to loosen it from her throat.
“Well, he told me to call him Ty|“Ah, well. I only came early tonight because I will be very late tomorrow. A dinner.”
“I know. I’ve been invited.”
Sinclair stopped halfway up the stairs. “You’ve been invited to dinner at the earl’s?”
When Elinor nodded, he exclaimed, “By the earl|The detectives exchanged a look.

"Did you threaten her?" asked Detective Holstijic.

"No."

"Where did you go after the library?"

"Home."

"Did you follow Marcie?"

"No. Like I said, I came home. Are you going to tell me what happened to Marcie|~
Isaac pointed out the graves as they rode up.  There were small little crosses that he had fashioned to mark out each one; nothing fancy, but well done for a fugitive from marauders.  Godfrey could sense the solemnity even before they came to a stop.  No one seemed to want to dismount, or that were on foot to approach the graves|A boy? Drugs? You can get anything you want here in Cancun, and I can take you there,” Pedro said.
“Just take me back to the villa, but tomorrow, or next trip, maybe. This life is still new to me.”
“We can bring someone over to the villa|"I see you took out a few of the guests."

"Guests?"

"Don't worry, they had it coming. But there're three more of them, probably unarmed. They were playing cards in the dining room before you rolled in."

"You okay? You seem-"

"No, I'm not okay|Kind people had dropped off a cold-cut platter so the Wynns could have sandwiches whenever they were hungry, and a pie, though Phillip anxiously told me he didn't know what kind it was. But he swore he had the name and a description of the dish written down.

"You better have a sandwich and a piece of pie. Then you'll know what kind it is," I said.

"Shouldn't I save all this for Mr. and Mrs. Wynn|As they began to argue playfully I went back to the textbook, opening to the appropriate page displayed on the front board and began to read the assignment.  But as I fiddled with my hands in my lap and read the words, I realized they were in English.  I didn’t understand what they were saying though|"The most important thing," Elena was saying earnestly, "is to protect Meredith. We've gotten a warning, and we need to take advantage of it, not sit around worrying about where it came from. If something terrible - something I brought somehow - is coming, we'l deal with it when it gets here. Right now, we look out for Meredith|Her brow furrows like she's still working all this out. Her blue eyes are heavy and I can see her struggle to push her way through the cobwebs. She's trying to find her way to wakefulness and reality.

"Are you really here?"

"Why wouldn't I be?"

"Because you should be at work and I could be dreaming|Dane held onto it in order to keep his balance and was relieved to see Bryn was secure in her position for the present.  A few loosened branches and leaves fell on top of them as if to attest to the strong jar they had just experienced.
“What’s down there?” asked Bryn whose eyes were wide with fear.
“It is a xenther,” said Dane|It’s addressed to Station 982. That’s us, Abbu. We should open it.”
“I will wait for the letter.”
“What letter?”
“They don’t send anything without a letter. I need to know what to do.”
“We can open the box and see what’s inside and still wait for the letter|Not that Catherine wouldn't set anyone's nerves on edge, but in the past, Bailey had been able to toss off a joke, roll those protuberant eyes of hers, and stay focussed. Now she was moody. Lia worried that she was going to blow up on the job. Some days she was pumped up and raring to go, others she seemed like she could hardly crawl out of bed. And some days, her mood turned on a dime, usually after a visit from Catherine|“He told me that the castor bean poison had been mixed into the frosting and that that would make me the best suspect, chemistry and baking.”
David looked a bit confused and he stayed quiet for a second.
“Green Eyes, you said that Pete told you the poison was in the frosting?”
“Yes and he said it made perfect sense with my background. What’s wrong?”
“I’m wondering when he found out that the poison was in the frosting|He slowly increased the power of the left engine to make sufficient speed to navigate closer to the sinking yacht. He was cross with himself that he could not master a decent landing on the sea. The hard pounding given to the old plane could not always be a great contribution to the strength of the airframe.
Warily he manoeuvred the sea plane into the direction of the yacht|Lady Maccon grappled for some appropriate response.

Felicity added, in a blatant attempt at distraction, "Speaking of which, you have gotten tremendously portly, haven't you? Is increasing supposed to cause you to swell quite so much as all that?"

Lady Maccon frowned. "I believe I have increased, as it were, to the maximum|But, the first time, in the reality I was born into, Napoleon won, and subjugated Britain and the rest of Western Europe to nearly 200 years of French rule. In fact, as an expert on me, you’ll be surprised to know that my original name was Jean Russelle.’
‘And how did you save the day, Jean|“Alright, there should be a page in here 
somewhere,” he said aloud as he paged through the book, eventually stopping at a page near the end.  “Found it.” 
In the page was a picture of a blood-red portal, just like the one on the wall in front of them, with writing underneath it. 
Charlie, Will, Sheila and Rocky all watched as Jacob kept his eyes on the page in the book and began to read the paragraph of writing below the picture of the portal|We need to follow the evidence, and so far this still has a lot of questions.”
“That’s where I have the advantage, John.  I don’t have to answer to anyone but myself.”
“Hunter, we’re friends, and I’ll pretend that I didn’t hear that.”
“What about protecting the girls, John|"You there," he called, raising his voice, "send word to the camp-"

"Why are you talking to them?" Arkady said. "Hurry and get loose, and never mind about your men, I am sure they will be all right! Those are them, those are the ones who put these chains on me!"

Temeraire jerked his head around to stare at Arkady|Answered all the questions truthfully but she didn't give up anything that would have complicated your life."

"Glad to hear that," Lawson said, sounding genuinely relieved. "I was afraid I might have to do some damage control this morning."

"No."

"Well, that's one bit of good news, at least."

"That's one of the things I admire most about you, Lawson|It was eerily quiet inside the house—the same nap-inducing breeze was coming through the window. But that’s the view from the hallway. I have to have a closer look. Hydra was hesitant as he looked back at the door—he was ready to run. But he forged ahead and tiptoed, slowly peeking into the room, when…
“Hi, Hydra|“Yes, I thought I was going to lose the baby.”
“I was scared too,” he stated, sincerity flooding his eyes.
“You were?”
“Yes, of course.  Why do you even ask?”
“This baby wasn’t exactly planned for.”
“Do you honestly think that I would want you to have a miscarriage|"Who'll even know? Don't you trust me?"

Helena suddenly found herself pinned beneath him. A flicker of anger danced in his eyes. Was she finally going to see her unshakable vampire lose his cool?

"I will know," he said. "And it is you who does not trust me, Helena|"I know, we still have lots to talk about, but it's hardly as if I'm going to bolt now. This could be a great chance for Rupert, and you too." She added, getting to her feet.

"You stole my identity," Alice said slowly. "They all think you're me."

"No, they think I'm Angelique, and you're Alice|He took his menu and opened it, and I was astounded by the next words that came out of his mouth.

"But we are not friends Ellery."

Ok, I take back the whole man has manners thing, he is just downright rude.

I opened up my menu. "Alright then Mr. Black, why don't we just stick to Miss Lane?" I saw him slightly grin from behind the menu|I felt like it wasn’t alright for me to be there without Robyn. I got back into my car and headed home. Although it no longer sounded so appealing, I still had a plane to catch. When I got home, I found a gift on my doorstep. I wasn’t really surprised when I read the note and saw that it was from Robyn|The Queen has—”
“No takers, Nancy,” said Duke, punching Bland in the groin.  The British secret agent went down, turning a curious shade of blue-orange.
When he went outside again, Duke was just in time to see the remaining pirates keel-hauling Ken Goodspeed by dragging him under an SUV.  
“Quit it,” said Duke.  His revolver cooperated and he shot several of the pirates|Just as Angie was completing her thought Chris walked into the bathroom.  She looked at Angie and me, then she handed me a card.
"What's this?" I asked.
"Her name's Vanessa Bell, she asked me to give you her card.  She'd like to talk to you," said Chris|And where did you get the unsweet kind?"

He was right. I had been drinking my weight in chocolate milk since sixth grade. But over the last few months, everything seemed sweeter, and I could barely stand more than a sip of chocolate milk. "The Stop and Steal orders it for Mrs. Honeycutt because she's diabetic|Screaming "No," she did her best imitation of a dolphin leaping out of the water and threw herself out of the chair at Dee. She soared through the air to land on the other woman-and the gun-as it went off.

The impact of the shot was like a punch, and Jo gasped for air that suddenly seemed absent. She was vaguely aware of Nicholas shouting her name and then he was there, lifting her away from Dee|A second meal was served in the late afternoon.

The second book in The Dragon Archives series is due to be released December 2014. Continue reading for a preview of Pursued by a Dragon|She opened her mouth to apologize when Nicholas burst out the front door, his face grim. "You need to come inside. We have a situation."

Logan tensed beside her and took a protective step closer, scanning their surroundings.

"What?" she asked.

"I'm so sorry, Hope," said Nicholas|But it doesn’t help me, does it?’
Amy gurgled and Tommy clutched his mother’s skirt.
Mary put an arm around Clara and led her away from the commotion. ‘Floyd will be absolutely fine, Clara.’
‘But he’s not a criminal.’
Mary stopped in her tracks and turned to Clara|“You are up early,” said Vo. “Most tourists get here late.”
“I’m not a tourist,” said Ana. 
“Oh, right. You have a job. You live here, don’t you?” 
Ana nodded her head, still looking down.
“I am guessing you are Russian,” said Vo|That was not some scheme to get revenge on Addison, at least not on my end. Didn't it feel real to you? I could not fake that with you."

He nodded. "So you've liked me all this time, from when we first met at camp. You weren't trying to get back at Addison|I don't know a better way of explaining it to you."

"So that's what you fought last night, like pure unadulterated evil?" Tristan asked and I nodded. "So those Shadow-things, that's what the Darkness is?" he tried to understand. No.... he tried to comprehend.

"Well, yes, they are part of the Darkness|She returns and says everything looks okay, but there are some motion sensor lights on the house on the right. Bernie Kosar flies away, perching himself on the highest point of the roof.

Six grabs Sam's hand and they turn invisible. I tuck the Chest under my arm and quietly follow them to the back fence. They reappear, and Six goes over first, then Sam|*Wait,* Graysfang said.

That's when she saw the small golden bump between his ears. The bump lifted, floated to the nearest perimeter stake, and uncurled its legs.

Surreal stared at the small gold spider as it busily spun a simple tangled web between two of the stakes. When it was done, it picked its way to the center of the web|But as you know, Macklin had little experience of powerful feelings. He was convinced it was a near-death experience, and made a mental note to have a cup of licorice tea before going to bed. 
"Would you like to stay for supper?" he said. 
"Oh we couldn't!" said Gladys. "I only wanted to--I mean--we couldn't--"
"There's plenty," said Macklin|I squinted at the creature, and saw a dark circle under its belly. “It's under its belly, but you have to get by the stinger first. That might cause us a problem.”
“No problem,” Seth replied and swung his sword in an ark. “We’ll just cut off the stinger|Four peripherals, Bryn.   At the Wayfarer.

Through the bond, I could feel Chase getting closer, moving faster, and I realized-belatedly-that Lake had loaned him her truck.

"Peripherals." I said the word out loud and let the ramifications wash over me. I ran harder, faster, every inch the alpha determined to get back to her pack|"Will you tell me ... what I am?"

"You're an angel," she repeated slowly, surprised to see Daniel close his eyes and moan in pleasure, almost as if they were kissing. "I'm in love with an angel." Now she was the one who wanted to close her eyes and moan|They all put their hands in the middle of the circle and repeated the chant.
	As the match restarted Herstaff grabbed the dynamite, passed across court to Indy. Herstaff's bear-mount charged down the outside and round Indy, just in time for him to grab the overhead pass that Indy threw to confuse the other team. Herstaff took a second to compose himself, leaned back and threw the dynamite|The battery on Logan’s radio must have been on the way out. So he told himself. There was no other explanation beyond Cygan and the staff at the White House having been overrun. 
Lizzie opened her eyes with a flutter. They had been on the icy road for an hour without incident. Jack was happy to do all of the driving|What kind of parent trusts a kid in high school to drive such an expensive car? I guess my dad isn’t the only one.
The school looks more like a college campus. There are sets of matching brick buildings. There is a huge library that I can’t wait to check out. I go into the biggest building, which is where the crowd seems to be going, and head toward the administration office to get my schedule|"You know," Molly said, smiling and placing a hand on Monson, "Monson is automatically on the team."
"What?!" Monson shot back, "What exactly am I automatically on?" 
"The Legion," Molly said, acting as if this was the most obvious answer. 
"Thanks Molly," Monson replied sarcastically, "and what is the Legion|The father doll fell to the ground. Magda tugged the smaller doll from the swing. She gripped the mother and child dolls in one hand and ran them across the yard.

A cold core, like a lethal lead ball, lodged right below Gray's sternum. The mother shoved the child under the tiny kitchenette table and ran back outside to the father|Had she not called and I not agreed to aid you, you would soon be meeting my brother.”
“Oh.”
Hypnos walked back to the circle.  “It is done,” he said, and vanished.
Maryann slumped forward on her knees.
Leah and Nora immediately went over to her.
Isabella grabbed her glasses, got out of bed, and ran over to Maryann|If Rick had been guilty of wanting Ev out of the way, why would he then be so stupid to ask Jay to generate reports from the system?  Jay wasn’t dumb and he would no doubt find the same changes.  In fact, he had discovered that someone had screwed around.
Maybe Rick didn’t think the changes would be discovered so quickly by someone other than Ev|“Well,” said Vandar, “how can I help you?”
“When we were studying the history of Frizland,” began Maximilian, “we came across some material about the War of Tears.”
“Yes,” said Vandar, warily, “and what did you find?”
“It wasn't so much what we found as what we didn't find,” said Maximilian|Kate, do you have time to sit for a minute?”

“Sure do, the brunch rush is about over. It’ll be pretty 

slow for an hour or so.

Did you have a nice flight, Mrs. Wembly?”

“ Please call me Teresa and yes, I had a smooth flight.”

“I’ll call you Teresa and you call me Kate|And last night as well ... in fact it really started yesterday. I was going to tell you, but then I was afraid you wouldn't believe me."

My mother did not reply.

"Mum?"

I looked at Lesley. "She doesn't believe me."

"You're not making any sense," whispered Lesley|No, there was no seemed about it, she did understand. Or, he thought, if not understand, she certainly accepted. Yes, that’s perhaps the better word. She fully accepted the miracle that was Ruth, that was water, with not even a trace of fear.
For Melissa smiled at Ananda when she said, “Yes, she’s a miracle|She could see Kim’s body lying in her living room battered and burned.
“Ms. Castillo, are you okay?” asked Officer Vasquez.
“I just realized that Kim died in my apartment tonight.  I can’t go in there,” she said in a shaky whisper.
“I can go in and gather some of your things for you,” said Vasquez|There were some quick glances between siblings: the Andrastes knew about the prophecy. Adonis raised his sleek eyebrows, playing it cooler than his offspring. “Do they? And you, James?”
“I never gave it much thought. The Paddingtons aren’t believers.”
“The Brethertons are, your mother’s side,” said Adonis|Nijil’s hand went limp, and her body grew still as her last breath escaped away. Lachelie kissed her lightly on the forehead, then embraced her one last time, weeping into her small chest, her brother holding them both. Graid turned, and went outside. Ilahon followed.
“It’s a shame that girl had to die,” mused Ilahon, as he struggled to keep up with Graid|Poor Sean. She was supposed to make a difference. But not this time... "Are you sure?"

"He was wearing a Medic Alert bracelet," David was saying. "He was a diabetic."

"I didn't know that."

David said nothing, allowing her a moment to grieve|Our fate as a people may depend in great measure on how we cast our votes this day. This may very well be our last hope for redeeming this nation from its God-ordained fate.”
As they neared the Hancock County Courthouse, where the case of People vs. Levi Williams had been postponed just a week before, they took in the view. The town of Carthage consisted of just a few dozen frame and log houses, a hotel, a jail, and the courthouse|"I bet this is the window Connor came in and out of when they were here," I said, climbing out.

I looked down, seeing the AC unit. The infected were following each other to the back of the church, and there were more than before. When the moaning began, it was almost as if they were calling each other, signaling that there was food|You hightailed out of our company as if you couldn’t wait to get away.” 
“I told you that I had stuff to do," Lorenzo stated.
“Your excuse sounded phony to me and phony to her too.”
“I had stuff to do,” he mumbled, irritated.
“Why don’t you like her, Lorenzo|He gestures wide. "We are all storks here, condemned to be unwound-but we've taken back our lives, and we're taking our revenge. So I ask you-do you want revenge?" He waits and receives a few guarded responses, so he raises his voice. "I said, do you want revenge|We aren’t doing anything,” the first girl said.
The third girl shook her head.
“If you want to have a turn you may,” the first girl said.  The third girl shook her head again, but the first girl lifted her sleeve.  The bracelet was gone.  Their eyes darted around the ground as they looked for the bracelet|Every few hours, one of them wheeled in the portable ultrasound machine -- Josh during the day, and Nellie in the evenings.  Lashonda couldn't understand the monochrome squiggles on its greenish-black screen, but she could read the expression on Josh's face.  The set of his jowls was serious; the angle of his brows concerned.
"Of course," he said, his face transforming to jovial jocularity, "we can't really tell from the ultrasound|“I suspect it doesn’t get a lot of use,” said Ronni, shaking her head. “Maybe the building was converted from something else…” Ronni trailed off as she watched her roommate. “Donna, what are you doing?”
Donna had opened the door to the stairwell. “Oh, just looking around,” she said.
“You’re going to get us kicked out,” said Ronni|“It’s Alonzo.”
Mitzy grimaced. She had a desk in the front with her staff, but she also had a private office where she could sign papers with clients. She rarely did other business in that office. She turned on her heel and disappeared into it now. 
“I’ve quoted you the lease terms at least three times, Alonzo|"Again, he left that up to you. However, he was adamant in his desire that it remain a private ceremony. He asked me to make sure, for instance, that no information be given to the newspaper regarding his death, not even an obituary. I got the sense that he didn't want anyone, aside from the three of us, to know that he'd even died|They weren't there, and for a moment I stood by the examination table in mute panic. I had washed them the week before and was certain I had placed them under the stairs. Where were the doctor's boots? From the kitchen came the clumping of the men's tread across the wooden floor. He was coming, and I had lost his boots|"What kind of plane is it? I don't want to pay this price for a crop-duster that still won't get you there in time."

Sunny sighed. "Why don't I just put him on the line? It'll save time." She handed the receiver to Chance. "He wants to know about your plane|"Oh, many a time, and was present one night when he discussed his often mentioned thoughts - that the Empire must not try to push further. Rather it should police the states which it now contains."

"Then Caesar Augustus did say this!" said the Legate in fascination.

"He cared about you," I said to the Legate|Heristo sighed and lowered himself onto the steps. “But even though I’m obviously only somewhat old, sometimes… sometimes I feel just plain old. My mind wanders these days, and I’ve got the most devilish pain in my back that just doesn’t seem to ever quite go away. Dreams?  No, it seems my day is done…”
“Of course not Heristo|Sister Lucile hung a rosary from Charlotte's waistband and handed her a new St. Joseph's Missal. “This is a gift from the Sisters. It is yours to keep whether or not you complete the process of becoming a vowed sister and joining us permanently.”
Charlotte blinked back tears. It was the first gift anyone had ever given her. It was also the only thing she actually owned that she could keep even if she left the convent|Faye tilted her chin back and looked at the ocean with narrowed eyes.

"You're right," Diana said. "You've learned a lot from just watching - and we've been a little lax with security. But I think you should hear the entire story from the beginning."

"I'll tell it," said Faye|I was sure Ben just did it to make sure I wasn’t alone.  But I didn’t mind; he was right, I didn’t want to be alone.
“We got Mr. Sampson for math,” Aria whined, “so we actually have to do…math.  But it’s the last required year at least, we won’t have to when we’re seniors|“Should we fly down into the main mine shaft?”
“No way!” answered Mom.  “If there is something down there, I don’t want to find out if its technology is great enough to pose a risk to the robot—we’re leaving.”

The moon quickly receded into the distance as they ap-proached earth|"I'll understand if anyone wants a different job," she said quickly. 
Chuck looked upset. "You're not kicking us off the team, are you?"
"No. But it...I don't think any of us knew what today would be like. I won't hold it against any of you if it's not something you can do again|Drive-Thru Chick's face brightens and she holds up a finger as she continues with the order from outside. "Be right there. Promise."

I turn back to Skater Girl, but instead of the warm thank-you I should be receiving she shakes her head, clearly annoyed. "Jocks."

My smile falters. Hers grows.

"How do you know I'm a jock|"Apparently they had only just begun their hike,
when about half a kilometer into the scrub, they saw a
whole heap of birds gathering near a clearing just off the
track a ways. Julia went over for a closer look; she thought
it might have been an injured animal or something. As
you can imagine, it didn’t take them long to figure out
that it was no animal|Correct me if I'm wrong, but he's one of the people who hid the trial from you, right?"

I looked away. "That's not important right now. Besides, he had his reasons."

"Yeah, which apparently didn't involve being open with you or fighting to get you there. Whereas me..." He shrugged. "I could get you into the trial|Meetings between Dr. Branon and the MWC delegates’ holograms currently occur in her private home in Kirov, California, about 60 miles northwest of San Francisco. 
Return to this and other news sources for Enlaces’ updates, which Dr. Branon stated will be occurring “regularly” and which promise to include more videos of her encounters, trainings, and education with the MWC delegates.
Dr. Branon and Ms. Enlaces plead with Earthers not to come to Kirov|Unfortunately, until Griff's absence this evening, she hadn't realized how much she enjoyed his company.

She rubbed her eyes to alleviate their burning. That she spent more time with Griff and Alix each evening probably contributed to her backlog of work and complete lack of sleep. Still, she hadn't broken her self-imposed promise. She'd kept a careful distance between herself and Griff|"I know why Mrs. Bethany invited human students to Evernight."

"Really? Why?"

I told Lucas about the deduction Balthazar and I had made about Mrs. Bethany's attempt to track ghosts, expecting him to share my satisfaction. Instead, his smile slowly dimmed. Confused, I said, "Come on, Lucas|Then she came along to a torch wrapped in silver wires, putted on a crystal support, very beautiful made and she lit it, being a gentle fire. In that moment the people burst into frantic applauses, making Angell to smile happily, watching the public. Was so many people, and from the trees she could see her Ravings how they were applauding. Vanilla was so close to burst, but not in applause like the rest of the world, but in tears|She chose to run away, and the only place where she would be safe was with our enemy. It's not as if she could have lived on her own."

"She betrayed us," said Gilda, knowing Maura had learned to do so from her.

"You betrayed us. Your actions set all of this in motion. I'm sure the damage you've done hasn't even finished playing out yet-at least, not for me and Maura|Arthur, aiding Simon unaware, blushed at her interest and quickly down-played his string of mishaps. "Trivial incidents, really. I just seem to be a clumsy thing."
"I think you are much less clumsy," Simon added, to help ease Arthur's obvious discomfort at the discussion.
"And a duke must not be clumsy|"Jericho and I know of at least three more teams of Resistance members stationed elsewhere across Africa and Southeast Asia, so we are hoping to get to them." Gabriel nodded his acceptance of the plan, but continued to stare at me to imply he had more questions.

"And then what? What will you do when you've assembled this army?" he inquired of me seriously, his eyes flaring brightly at the use of the word, "army|Evens walks up to the lead truck, sees a Major in the front seat, and salutes him. Then, he says, "Good morning, Major. May I see your ID and orders?" 
The Major hands them over and Evens checks everything carefully. 
Satisfied, he hands them back, saying, "Welcome to the middle of nowhere, Major|Besides, she had his curiosity up.  She’d never really showed an interest in talking to him before.
Wendy returned with the Coke and the shot, left them on the table, and then disappeared back into the swarm of writhing arms, legs, pelvises.  Eddie slammed back the shot and waited for the warmth to work its way into his body before chasing it with a bit of Coke|"And c'mon, you have to admit that this will make one heck of a story when you get back to New York."

He stared at her in disbelief before glancing at Jeremy. "She's the one?" he asked.

Jeremy nodded.

"She's pretty," Alvin commented. "Maybe a little on the pushy side, but pretty|“No, Ragu…the losers treat. I’m buying today.”
“Okay, Benjy-boy, if you insist.”
“But I don’t have any money on me.” 
“Don’t worry about it, Johnny B. It’s on me.”
“Yeah, but I’m one of the losers|Once we know if he has living relatives, decisions can be made.”
“I’m sure you can be part of the plans, Rupert, once his relatives are found.”
He visibly relaxed. Rupert loved to plan a party and Sam could already see the cogs turning.
Beau said, “You know a lot about this man’s life, Rupert|asked Maximilian, forgetting his promise to be gentle with the old man.
“No, no,” insisted The Keeper, fearing that he would lose this job as well, “I don't do this often. I just had a sleepless night last night. My stomach was playing up and my arthritis . . .”
“Enough,” said Maximilian|"Yep. Every game all the players' stats change just a little."

"But this is a big one," says Liam, reaching over to get a pen from his nightstand. He writes in the book. "There. It's changed." Closing the book, he puts it down on his bedside table along with the pen|It's because I grew up in an annexed region, and even after those places become Gemman, it's only marginally less difficult to make something of yourself in the 'real' RUNA than it is coming from the provinces." She chucked Tessa's chin. "That, and I like hard luck cases."

"You sound like Justin," muttered Tessa|In the blink of an eye, we’re standing in the middle of a burning room. The first thing I see, is the scaffolding they’d been using to paint, had fallen in front of the closed door, barricading any possibility of escape. Now I understand how they became trapped in the first place.
I try scanning the room, but I can’t see through the clotting smoke|“Wow, Peter, that’s fantastic! Are you all right — was anyone hurt?”
“Not too bad. One wounded, but he’ll be okay. Even the bad guys aren’t too bad, just a couple headaches. Everything worked better than expected by military standards.”
“That’s so good to hear, Peter|It broke his heart knowing she would never know who he was, believing she had been abandoned. It broke his heart knowing that she would never know her real name, the one given to her by her parents when she was born.   
He waited by the Library.  Watching, making sure they took her in.  He was terrified when he saw Axel walk away with her, he followed her not knowing what he would do, just following until for some reason that he still doesn’t understand – he saw Axel look down at his sweet baby girl and turn around running, running fast, back to the Library|Again, I tried to push him away. "I don't want or need to take advantage-"

"Now stop." He moved his hand to caress my cheek. "I know you don't. You never have. But I've told you before that you own me. Whether you take advantage of it or not, I'm yours|A few hours later, Carolyn called. “Hi, Peter.”
“Hi, lady.  How are you?”
“We’re good, Peter.  He’s in therapy right now, and I wanted to call you to thank you for talking to him.”
“He’s pretty special to me too, Carolyn|"I don't like being told what to do or how to think or where to live. You've mentioned the advantages of merging, but what are the disadvantages?"
He paused.
"I can't think of any," Bok said.
Nisha and Rachel glanced at each other in amazement.
"Bok, why have one billion Omanji decided not to merge|“How can you know all about being a Wanderer and how to find the Travelers, but you don’t know anything about the Light?”
“I know about the Light. I know where it comes from and I know why. That’s how I know you’re not making any sense.”
“I told you, it’s complicated|In fact, she'd heard the other day Tracey was seeing a cowboy from out near Bozeman, so whatever little flirtation the two of them had must not have worked out.

Would Jake have acted differently if she'd been available when they'd hooked up at Bella's wedding? She thought the answer might be yes. Now that her relationship with Cody was over and she'd moved into the Cruz ranch Big House, a sort of charged friendship had arisen between her and Jake|"It's not your fault. Nash should have stopped. He knows the rules, and this is entirely on him. You're not to blame no matter what you think." Zero reached over, squeezing her hand.

"Are you all this nice?"

Zero laughed. "Not many people would say we're nice|Sarah could sense that Charlton was deeply upset by what he knew. What could she do about it? He did his best to cover it, and she thought maybe she should leave it that way. She did not realize the intensity of the anguish he felt. 
Hixson saw the conflict in Charlton, too. He didn’t know exactly what his brother was thinking, but he had the idea it had something to do with Sarah|‘Well they’re not Jack!’ Percy cried.
‘No, they aren’t. And I bet if you talked to some of them I’m sure you’ll find another friend.’
‘Too late.’
‘What do you mean? Why is it too late?’
‘It’s a battleground now,’ said Percy|"He is," Sofia said at the same time Ash said, "I am."

The duke looked between the two with rapt fascination. "Interesting development."

The food arrived the very next second the duke opened his mouth, which was a welcome interruption as far as Sofia was concerned. She hadn't slept very well, considering she'd shared the bed with Ash|Everyone fel silent, and I real y hoped that that was the end of this particular conversation. Then Nick said, "I heard he tried to cut your heart out in a cel ar."

If everyone hadn't been hanging on my every word, they certainly were now. "That's not true,"I said evenly. I could feel Cal's gaze on me, but I kept my eyes on Nick|After the divorce, when Natalie went away to college, Annie could return to Mystic, maybe even open that bookstore......

Dreams. They were such precious commodities, and she'd given so many of hers away without a fight. Never again.

She turned to her dad. "Let me ask you something, Dad. Do you think this town could use a bookstore|Pretending to accept the explanation, he nodded and held out the suit jacket. She glanced down at her chest and then back at his face. He smiled, but his eyes didn't follow her gaze. He'd already memorized the sight of her pink ni**les beneath the sheer silk.

She rotated and allowed him to help her into the jacket|It was very freeing. There would be no more hiding, no more tiptoeing around the conversation. Logan and I were together. Plain and simple. We cared for each other and were doing what felt right.

That didn't stop my stomach from sinking the second door swung open. Dr. Andrews strode into the room, casting a cautionary glance in my direction before turning his attention to Logan|"Anybody worried enough to want to save her. One of the firefighters, a

neighbor-anybody."

"Assuming the blue flash on the tape really was evidence of a Wild Power," Pierce said.

"I think it was." Jez glanced at Morgead. "It sure looked like blue fire. And it certainly was some kind of

Power|He picked her up, walked to the bedroom door, and slowly pulled it open. The hallway was dark, quiet. He crept down it, heard Rachael's mother snoring in the guest room.

Rachael's sister, Elise, was asleep on the sofa in the den. The creak of the front door opening made her shift, but she didn't wake|I wondered what it was called. So it’s like for fencing, right?”
“Are you messing with me? You must fence. You move like a fencer.”
“Why do you say that?”
“Grey, you remember how we met, right?”  
“Of course, but what does that have to do with fencing|I manage to pull in a shaky breath while I stand there looking down the aisle at Collins who's eyes have found me and is gazing back. He's traded in the T-shirt and jeans from this morning and now wears a black tuxedo, which even from this distance makes him look so handsome that I ache to be alone with him.

Sophie slides a piece of paper into my hand and my fingers shake as I unfold it and see that it's a note from Collins|It was I who owed her thanks, the one who I would be grateful to for the rest of my life for her son.

My attention was drawn to him. This beautiful man who stood there, staring at me, waiting for me, as if I were his life.

I knew I was, just as assuredly as he was mine|That's what you always used to say, and you were always better than you claimed.'
Jina  replied, 'But never as good as you.' In the event, he surprised himself by hitting three of the first four targets at which he aimed. Opting for caution, he deliberately missed one of the last three targets|Is that my shirt you’re wearing?”
“You’re unbelievable.” I almost yell. “It’s Sean’s,” I say with confidence.
“No, that one is definitely mine.” Zachary insists. Check the label. He must have stolen it from my house.”
I sit back on the bed, pull up the collar and look at the label|“I’m afraid he’s going to need a lot more than a quart of milk, pound of cold cuts, and box of Devil Dogs.”
“I gotcha, Mike.” 
“Bean, I know you’re a big fan of Three’s Company, but don’t get any grand ideas like inviting him to bunk down with us.”
“You don’t have to worry about that, Mike|"Logan said they were on the way to a friend of the family's house. That was why they were in Virginia. Did she have any friends who lived in Virginia?"

"No, not that I know of," he answered.

"Sarah? Does that name mean anything to you? When I was with Connor, he said he was going to see Sarah|The night we were almost together will come rushing back. I can't do it.

Peter cuts his gaze from Trevor and takes in my reaction. "We should stick to the basics. Advanced moves are very challenging. A novice would have issues and we don't want to single anyone out. Now-"

"I'm not a novice|That does not look good so I nudge Kelly under the table. He nods his understanding of the problem.
“What about Kelly? You don’t believe you can trust him, do you?” A desperate edge colours Sam’s voice.
“I’m sticking to what I said last night.” I reply while directly making eye contact with Kelly|Let’s hear it.”
Cheyenne searches the drawers until she finds a wine opener. “Willow needs to practice her magic.”
I give her a doubtful look. “I think a fire extinguisher is more what we’re going to need.”
“Wine will help you relax. Tell her, Ryan, she needs to be relaxed|Amanda was slow to pick up on what her husband meant, “Oh yes, I see.  Yes.  Especially since he is going to London.”
“Who knows,” said Art bitterly, “Perhaps I’ll meet up with him for a few beers.”
“I don’t think that you would like him,” said Amanda|“Bagel, blue,” he said.
Bagel immediately went to the pile, dug through it, and brought Adam another yellow toy. “I said blue, Bagel.” Bagel again went to the pile and again brought a yellow toy and placed it at Adam’s feet. “I don’t understand what your problem is, Bagel|He began to scanning the hard wood floors and moving the couch, coffee table, bookcase, and stereo player aside in frantic search for his pet. “Sophie?” He called again, growing distraught that she would ever answer his call again. “What have you people done with my dog?”
“That…thing is being kept at a nearby kennel|At least they don't have the car key."
The car engine started. Nisha laughed.
"Never mind!"
As they walked closer, the children spotted them and the engine turned off. Nisha walked to within about five meters of the tallest one, who was slightly taller than her. She pointed to herself and said, "Hello, I'm Nisha|I promised myself that I was going to cool it around Tucker today for Wendy's sake, no matter what he throws at me. No rude remarks. No comebacks. I'm going to be on my best behavior.

"I like her." I lean forward and stroke Sassy's neck.

"She's the horse we put little kids on."

"Tucker, shut up," says Wendy|The Longorias were seated at the main table with Balbino Jr. keeping a watchful eye on them.  
“You've met my sister, Jacqueline, haven't you?” asked Ivana to Doña Chona.
“Yes, we've met her,” said Doña Chona as Jacqueline gave them a sneering glance that sized them up in one sweep of her eyelashes.
“The gentlemen next to her are Dario Quintana and his brother Fernando,” explained Ivana|“You can say that again,” replied Max.
The man looked hesitantly at Max and then at me. He pursed his lips slightly and nodded, giving the impression that he had just made an important decision. “Bet you boys would like a hot shower,” he said.
“Can’t think of anything I’d like more,” replied Max|Currently he had his postman's badge on; the Lancre postal service consisted of taking the mailbag off the nail where the coach left it and delivering it to the outlying homesteads when he had a moment, although many citizens were in the habit of going down to the sack and rummaging until they found some mail they liked. He touched his helmet respectfully at Granny Weatherwax.

'Got a lot of letters, mum,' he said to Nanny Ogg. 'Er. They're all addressed to, er, well... er... you'd better have a look, mum|"Of course. I'll drop it at the front desk of Soren Security. In the same envelope with Trey's," she added with a conspiratorial glint in her eye.

"You aren't going to leave this alone, are you?"

"Not a chance. I have a good feeling about you and Trey|I continued meeting with a therapist for a year or so afterward, in addition to going to weekly self-help meetings. It isn't as if I haven't gone down that road."

Julia frowned. "You're in recovery and you don't go to meetings. I haven't said much about it before, but that's a serious problem. On top of that, you still drink|“I don’t know, never met one.”
Razz is still smiling, “Just watch.”  He lifts the cube off the stand. Two brick size holes open on all four walls.  Water rapidly flows from them.
“So that’s the trap huh? If you don’t solve it fast enough, you drown|Balls-deep and he hadn't put on protection.

I didn't mean to pounce on her.

He'd actually planned a whole speech that he'd meant to say to her. But then he'd taken one look at her and desire, uncontrollable need, had struck him like lightning. When he'd pulled her into his arms and kissed her, he'd been a goner|There are DVDs behind that shelf," he explained, pointing to the built-ins that framed the gigantic fireplace. Then, as if deciding that was insufficient, he walked toward them. "Here, let me show you."

I followed Sebastian to the left of the fireplace.

"It's hinged," he said, pulling on a discreet handle that lay at the edge of the shelf|Karl had quite a few helpers in his house that had tennis courts, stables, horses and so he couldn’t risk going there. The park itself had horse riders, bicyclists, hikers, joggers and cows too. He didn’t expect to find cows in a public park, but there they were, peacefully grazing about. Bob wondered what it would be like to be a cow|"Including one of those costumes," Jeff said, hands in action, "that looks like a saddle and has a little cowboy on top."

"And one of the chimera heads was born," Catcher said.

"Hey, better than the real thing," I said. "What do you even do with a chimera?"

"What wouldn't you do with a chimera|Matt couldn’t help but smile. It was good to be free from the claustrophobic nearness of the trees. A grassy plain stretched out ahead into the distance. Grey predawn lifted the gloom and made it easy to see underfoot, helping them to travel at speed for many miles. Just before the Sun reached mid-point on its journey across the sky, they reached a small circular forest in the middle of the plain|Sarah seemed not to hear her.  She sat down in the mud and looked at her shoeless foot.  “Sarah!”
“Get back with the women!” an angry soldier yelled and reached for Esther’s arm.  Esther ducked under his grasp and fell on her sister.
“Sarah, it’s me, Esther|A needless comment in light of the obvious signs, but I felt like I had to draw my companions’ attention to the fact. They were plodding along, every now and then casting a glance upward, but otherwise appeared unconcerned.
A raindrop hit the tip of my nose, sliding over my lips. I wiped it away. “Shouldn’t we be looking for shelter|Shaun prompted.

Mason rubbed his jaw in a thoughtful, considering way, but said nothing more. A whole minute must have passed before I was able to breathe easy. Because Mason was right. The fastest way to get to the highway was to travel southeast. But now that I knew where we were, I wasn't taking them to the highway|Poppa was gritting his teeth in pain. His arm was broken and badly cut from the sharp corner of the tool box. His hand was crushed where the mule had stood on it.
“Poppa, lay down on the table. We’ll help you.” Hixson instructed.
“Are you sure about this, Hixson|Dervish returned a few minutes later, but I was safe in my room by then, and had splashed my face with cold water to take away the bright red flush I'd worked up in the cellar.

Dervish has spent most of the day since then in his study, as he often does, reading, making phone calls, surfing the Net. Time's dragged for me. I have only one burning desire - to get back down the cellar|When he'd done that I eased the baby into the crib, propping him on his side with a small firm pillow at his back, and covering him with one of the blankets Ellen had given me. I'd been aware Martin was still in the room, and I stepped quietly over to see what he was doing squatting on the floor.

Martin was plugging in a brand-new nursery monitor he'd extracted from the box he'd had under his arm. He untwisted the tie around the cord and moved the transmitter close to the crib|Finally Poindexter said, “That was weird today, wasn’t it? I mean, that Skinpeeler guy threatening us, and taking us to that stinky place.”
“Yeah,” I agreed. “Weird. I don’t know why he started coming after me. I had no idea where Mr. Marlin was.”
“He probably just picked you at random,” said Poindexter|James’s guardian.
“Have the Pegasus take him home,” He said solemnly. “I will accompany him as well, for I don’t see a choice. I can hide behind a Pegasus so they won’t see me. I’m sorry.” We all strapped James to the back of his Pegasus|Her longevity and the willingness of student leaders to tell their secrets to her made what she knew indispensable to the task at hand. It also didn’t hurt that she arrived before just about anyone else to the third floor and thus Mike could escape too much attention by making his visit then.
It took her a second, but she saw right through his disguise. “What can I do for you, Mike|My mom likes me, even if she doesn't know that she's supposed to love me. I'm relieved.

"Have you ever been inside Memorial Church?" I ask her when there's a lull in the conversation.

She shakes her head. "I don't go to church, as a rule."

Interesting. Not that Mom was ever fanatical about church or anything, but I always got the impression growing up that she liked church|Duke decided he could go for a can of Freak Out energy drink.  He exited the HUMWAY and stepped into the convenience store, momentarily forgetting that any convenience store he entered was invariably and immediately robbed by thugs.
“This is a robbery!” said a ski-masked thug, who stood next to two more ski-masked thugs.
“This is a fist-head,” said Duke|Tzader had stood here long enough for the sun to set and turn downtown Atlanta into a sparkling jewel.

Evalle had been in that hole since this morning.

He wanted justice, but he would settle for satisfaction.

When energy charged through the air he didn't turn to welcome the presence that arrived.

That might appear as though he were pleased to see her.

"Are you not happy to see me, Tzader|In seconds he's crouching in front of me, both of his hands bracing the sides of my head. "Love, are you okay? Adria-baby, look at me." I lift my eyes to see his face is tormented by worry. "Adria...." He crushes his lips against my forehead.

When he pulls away, I look at him and tell the truth for the first time: "No, Isaac, I'm not okay|“Ladies,” Todd warned in an attempt to keep the volatile situation from progressing.
 “And what is that suppose to mean?”
 Ursula flashed her patented sarcastic smile.
 “Oh don’t take offense. It’s just that it’s hard to determine who the real English are from the foreigners these days.” 
“As much as you may hate us, I’m not a foreigner|Setzer smiled reassurance. “Terra, remember what I said before? Where you are, home is. Be truthful when you tell them, listen to what they say, and go from there.”
Terra giggled suddenly. “You sound like Edgar.”
Setzer chuckled. “I’d rather you say he sounds like me, Terra|Michael and Louis Blake walked alongside each other up Missile Avenue toward the town hall. 
“That’s right,” Blake said.
“Where were you?”
“In one of the towers. I was watching you, to see how you’d react. I didn’t sense much fear. Mostly excitement.”
Michael shrugged. “I haven’t learned enough about this place to be afraid|I didn’t know what was worse; waiting for her to unload on me or the quiet bumpy ride from Texas to California in an old truck.
Agent Fields slowed down to pull onto the exit ramp. “We’re almost there. I suggest you check the computer for your mission.”
I reached back and felt the laptop back forcefully placed in my hand. I didn’t want to start a fight in the truck|Love."

And so it was, but Manella said to Raych after the ceremony, "Your mother may have attended the wedding because you insisted, Raych, but she looked like one of those thunderclouds they sometimes send sailing under the dome."

Raych laughed. "She doesn't have the face to be a thundercloud|He said reluctantly, "It will not be simple finding her if she does not want to be found."

"I won't stop-"

"That's exactly what you have to do if Mairi chooses to disappear. I searched for her for years, and I am no poor man without resources. Her aunts have connections and they're...good. I only recently learned that they had studied my every movement and by doing so, they were able to prevent me from uncovering any lead that would take me to Mairi|Julia held her tight for a moment, then stood up and said, “Let's get you out of these ridiculous clothes.” She opened the closet and saw Lizzie's play clothes on the floor. “What's this?”
Lizzie smiled. “I changed.” Julia noted that Lizzie did not say that Grace had made her change|Slipping around groups of schoolchildren who were staring wide-eyed at the mock-up, she headed for the security desk. Visitors to NASA, as well as their destinations within the facility, were logged into a computer. Megan was wondering where she would find Jon Smith when she caught a glimpse of him walking beneath the mock-up.

"Jon!"

Smith was startled to hear his name, but his frown turned into a smile when he saw Megan|Sarila asked, counting their numbers and dreading the outcome. They were evenly paired tonight which meant that Kasar might try and dance with her.

"Never mind those two, tell us about the one behind you Sara," one of the females said, eyeing Kasar up and down his magnificent physique.

"Nancy, Julie and Cindy, this is Kasar|When my legs buckled, Jeb lowered me to the ground and held a canteen to my lips as he had in the night.

"Let me know when you're ready," Jeb told me. His voice sounded kind, though I knew that was a false interpretation.

Someone sighed impatiently.

"Why are you doing this, Jeb|"I miss them. Ben and I need to come over soon and spoil them rotten."

I laughed at that. She and Hot Ben had made a real go of their relationship. Tracey even had a full carat sparkler on her ring finger to prove it. I'd had to feign ignorance when she'd told me that he'd proposed|Some said it was the river divided us, but it were more than that – they were a different class, over there,” the thumb jerked again, “and we knew where we was best off.  Did alright, we did, out of Clandecys and Monkfords and Acres.  Nothin’ left now,” he finished sadly, “most of ‘em dead, land all sold.”
“River?” Dean asked, fascinated.  “I grew up here, and I never heard of a river|Will and Starr got up from the floor slowly, catching their breath, a feeling of power in both of them.    
“What in the world?” spoke Will, who just noticed Lauren to have appeared to have changed into some sort of dark-gray monster with wings laying on the floor upon her clothes.    
“She didn’t stay calm,” said Starr|Justice sent his brother a hard glare, but Jefferson was rocking back and forth on his heels, clearly enjoying himself.

Maggie straightened up, fisted her hands at her h*ps and stared down at him with the stern look of a general about to order troops into battle. "He did hire me, though, Justice|Shad pulled the bike up to Freddie, who untied it and lashed the seat of the bike to the bottom of the limb.  Freddie used the mountain bikes detached inner tubes to secure it into place.   He wound the tubes around and around the limb at least ten times.
“I sure hope it will hold,” said Freddie|“Well,” said Carley, eyeing me as we started to walk down a street that looked much like the one before, “that’s really weird.”
I didn’t know how to respond. I just looked at my hand and back at Carley.
Carley shook her head. “You can wash it off when we get to Mrs. Fritters’.”
I didn’t want to wash it off. Never in my life did I want to clean my hand again, but I didn’t say that to Carley|"Sure," said Kae, and offered her a hand up. I accepted, and then we went to find Holly and Stephanie.
On the way inside, we met Stephanie and Mallory. They looked worried.
"Where Holly?" asked Stephanie. "She promised me she'd help me get my stuff together."
"Yeah, and Eli said he'd put our things into packs," said Mallory|"Brandon Mitchell, ma'am. Like I said, we live next door, and Auggie lets me drop by to use his darkroom. I really am sorry," he told Hallie again, looking shameful.

She managed a brave shrug. "I'll be OK...... Eventually."

"I was actually looking for you and your sister," Brandon continued, his gaze fixed on Hallie|"We're going to steal all the presents under the big tree at the Rosewood Country Club. All of the decorations, too. It's perfect timing, because tomorrow morning is the annual brunch where everyone opens their gifts. It's going to be just like How the Grinch Stole Christmas! Let's see if the snotty rich people gather around the tree when it's bare|Jeffrey tried to wait patiently and not interrupt but had always found himself unable to keep from blurting out important information when someone was on the phone.
"...yes, sir, it seems to be coming on whenever the convict's heart rate accelerates. Yes, sir. Uh-huh. I'm sorry, sir, can you hold on a second? Mr. Avery seems to have something he needs to tell me," Lotinger said, angling the phone away from his mouth and focusing his attention on Jeffrey|The Wedgewood collection alone -"

Cash's body went visibly tight before he clipped out, "You sell one piece of my legacy, I'll see you in court, day in and day out, until the only thing you have left is the clothes on your f**king back."

Abby, already close to Cash, got closer and her fingers curled around his.

His hand gave hers a light squeeze right before Alistair grinned and scoffed, "Your legacy|She held a garment in her hand, which she appeared to be mending.  So this was the Lady Emily Shelton!, thought Adrian.
“Yes, lad, how may I be of service to you?”  Her voice was clear and resounded with a tone of knowledge and wisdom.
“Yes, Madam, my name is Adrian|“Do you have any idea how stupid you’re being?”
Gabby’s eyes flashed with anger. “I’m not stupid.” She shoved her way back. “Yeah, I might not be the smartest person in the world, but I’m not an idiot.”
Jesse sighed and shook his head. “That’s not what I meant, Gabby|If things went well, they would return as the sun set, dragging the nets behind the boat, full of fish, enough for their small family and enough to sell at the market.

Harto watched his son Eko paddling at the front of the boat, and pride washed over him. Soon, Harto would retire and Eko would do the fishing|Not far. It’s my house now, I should feel comfortable in my own yard.
I don’t even rush as I walk outside into the sunshine, pausing a minute to let the rays hit my face. Being outside like this doesn’t make me feel trapped. It takes away the feeling that I’ve lost my freedom|Hydra asked them to scour the bottom of the stream for whatever metal objects they could find. Hydra felt good about his friends and how they were making his job so much easier.
After a thorough search, Veeda approached Hydra and whispered something to him. His eyes widened, then he cleared his throat. Veeda had told him that there were three hydrants at the bottom of the stream|Surely Archie had to see that Cass was going to die if this continued. Lara may have started to see some sense in his theory, but that didn't mean it was all correct.
"Watch." He whispered. She turned her head to look at Cass. Her screams were becoming deafening. Her throat sounded rough, but she still screamed|Let the rest of the world save or destroy itself.

No, that wasn't exactly true. Centuries before, he had tried to help.

Madness had swept through his village. Turning all those of his kind against one another. He'd tried to fight the madness, tried to save his brother.

But there were some who couldn't be saved|Two people. That's it."

"Okay." A smile crossed his face, and I knew he wasn't going to try anymore. Robbie was stubborn, but he knew I could out-stubborn him. "So what do you want to name your boat?

I thought about it for a moment, frowning slightly as I went over names|"Gregor," said Mareth. "You have need of medical assistance as well. You must come with me."

"Is she going to live?" asked Gregor.

"I cannot say. But she is getting the best treatment we are able to give. You do not help her, or anyone, by letting your wounds inflame," said Mareth|But even through the dimness of the place, they could spot it … sitting directly in the middle of the room, large and elegant.

The tablet they had come here for. 

Ion’s tension died out in an instant, as he released a great sigh of relief. 

“We’ve made it.” whispered Qyro by his right, his eyes on the tablet|But she knew from her brother Tony that Elizabeth and Jon had actually hired people to transform the house. Once again, Melanie reflected, just like when we were kids—Elizabeth, always the center of attention, taking credit for everything.
“How’s Aunt Casey holding up?”
“Surprisingly well. She’s in there.”
Elizabeth pointed to the small room and leaned closer to Melanie|Roku touched parts of the engine, pausing for a moment on each one to feel the temperature. He knocked on a plastic tank bolted to the side panel next to the twin batteries. It thumped hollowly under his knuckles.
“Electrical problem?” asked Marius from the cab.
“Could be the starter,” said Roku|He worked his way through the rest of the crowd and through the doorway, fielding all the questions and giving what he felt were the appropriate answers. Once inside the apartment, he fed Bagel and then called Debbie. He didn’t take Bagel for his nightly walk because he didn’t want to have to fight his way through the crowd again. Bagel didn’t seem to be too anxious so he thought he could wait until after he talked to Debbie|Lil just had time to jump inside before he slammed the door shut. Why did she let Tome do the talking?
“You’re not still angry about that thing with puppies,” Tome asked in bored tone.
“Puppies?” Lil asked before she could stop herself.
“Possessed puppies,” Delios corrected. “Of course, you didn’t mention that they were possessed|Furn figured Catlett’s address would be closer to the city and a long way from here. He got to the radio before Breeze could cue up one of his European hip hop collections, tuning to the Parliamentary Broadcast. There was a speech in progress: the Minister for the Environment defending the Murray-Dowling River Scheme.
‘You’ll put me to sleep at the wheel,’ said Breeze|“There are some perks to staying here.”
But Isabelle is being stubborn. “Cam, I really appreciate everything you’ve done for me, but I’m a big girl. I can take care of myself. I’ll handle things with Brent.”
Over my dead body.
I scowl. “I won’t hear of it, Isabelle|"I suppose not. -Where have you been living, Sheerin?"

His look was vague. "Here. There. I went back to my apartment first, but the whole building complex had been burned out. Just a shell, nothing salvageable at all. I slept there that evening, right in the middle of the ruins|I had feelings for Brooks that had never gone away, but there are no rules for who you love. I felt the same way for his brother, whom I was marrying.

Although, a part of me was still very upset with Branch and the way he'd wedged himself into a relationship with me, knowing how his brother felt. It didn't seem fair and I felt sorry for Brooks|How can this be possible when you are more than sixty-five?”
“As you know, Nicchi, I have no answer to that question. I wish I did.”
Looking more seriously at them, he took out a sheaf of papers from his saddlebag. “When I said, ‘Let me introduce myself’, I was serious|You loved her."

"I still believe that some sacrifices are too great to be made."

Styx ignored the odd tightness in his chest. He didn't want to know what it might mean.

"This woman means nothing to us."

Viper looked annoyingly unconvinced. "It is your decision to make, Styx|I wondered how long it would take the priest to realise I had actually left - not long I supposed - and what he would do about it. He might well get hunters from the village to hunt me down. They had agreed to build his temple readily enough. At any rate I put as much distance as I could between me and the village|Bowen asked.

He wanted to know all, because he was haunted by strange sensations. He could swear that Genevieve was at his side, her hand touching his face. It was a soothing balm to his pain, and he hadn't wanted her to leave. Only, when he'd awakened Geoffrey and Deaglan were present and there was no sign of Genevieve|Edgar rubbed the back of his neck and took a step further into the room. “From what I can discover, at one time she apparently contracted to work for the Empire.”
“Tweak number two,” Setzer said in a toneless voice. The Empire? Of course, a great many people had worked for the Empire|He had his ideas, and let me tell you, Missy, he don't like anything other than the best. He's got real nice taste. I'd've rather had a jukebox in the corner with some good ol' rock 'n' roll, but Crew insisted on a piano. I hate to admit it, but I like the piano|My father hugs her. I look at Lisa.

“I love her,” I say. “I’m in love with your daughter. I’ll take care

of them.”

We’ve got this.

Lisa can’t even look at me.

They both hate me.

“This started before I even met you, Lisa|I couldn't believe how this night had gone. I should've been out with Isabel right now.

"My name's not -"

"He can go sit in the car, too," I said. "Have a good night, all. I'm out." I left them there. As I climbed up the deck stairs, I wondered if I should call Isabel|She stood beside Zach as Michael pulled out of the driveway and down the street. They returned her bags to the house and closed the door.

"Do you know where Nolan lives?"

"Yeah. I drove him home a couple of times when he first started working for my dad. Before he started driving."

"I think the fastest way to find Becky is to find Nolan|Brian looked at Milt and shook his head sadly. “Milt, it’s okay, these are friends. I know Sven from way back.” Brian turned back to Sven. “Sorry, he’s had a shock I think, he’s alright though.”
“We’ve all had a shock,” Sven said, offering his hand to Milt|“Humph!”
Sacha dried himself as much as he could and left the bathroom heading towards his dorm, putting on his watch, with Pip in tow.  Matron was coming up the stairs with a pile of towels.  She looked at Sacha’s bedraggled state.
“Looks like someone has been giving you a shower, Sacha|You can manage,” said Ana, and sat down at the table to eat as well. 
Zoe continued to sit in the living room, her feet propped up at the coffee table.
Ana said, “This also means that when you start school, you’ll have to do homework on your own. That goes for you, too, Zoe|In my dreams I somehow manage to arrive in time to stop Patty from leaving with that guy.” He tells me while he slowly withdraws his hand. I feel sure he senses the strangeness between us. 
“That’s understandable. I haven’t had any like that; just this weird reoccurring dream about a tunnel that is sort of obliquely about Patty. At least I think it’s about Patty|There was a moment of silence.

"Freak," Vee choked. "You saw him nak*d? Where did it happen? His Jeep? His house? Your bedroom?"

"I did not see him nak*d! It was sort of an accident."

"Uhhuh, I've heard that excuse before," said Vee|Tracy scowled, expressing her disapproval at taking on more passengers. Shane acted like he didn’t notice, turning around at the front of the first bus and dividing the kids into two groups.
“Kelly, will you please help this group onto our bus?” he asked. “The rest will ride with you, Tracy|I dug back into my philosophy lessons too, anything to take my mind off what had happened.

On Sunday, five days after my day in the park, Lucas asked gently if I didn't think I should try again.

"You know, get back out there, see if you can find another that you might be able to help."

"I don't think I can do it, Lucas|Two, I may not have a wife or kid depending on me, but Haynes Racing has four hundred employees who count on me to keep roofs over their heads and food in their family's stomachs. I have no intention of letting them down. That's why I don't take stupid chances.

"I'm betting your father didn't either|His words pierce my tiny heart and hurt it so kindly. “I have not forgotten you. For you are very, very special to me.” I feel both the drums of our hearts pound proudly faster and louder. A notion of doubt warns me, “But, I am tiny and useless. How can you possible think I’m special|The true princess must be you, Lizzie. You are the one who will help us break the Code of Claw."

"Then I have to stay, Gregor," said Lizzie. "I can't leave and let everybody die."

"What about Dad?" asked Gregor.

"I don't know," said Lizzie|He turned to Napalm, “thank you very much for raising me, I am eternally grateful. Goodbye.”
The wolf then stood solidly on all four legs facing the far away giant, and braced himself as he opened his jaw wide. A blue light began to form the open jaw as if coming from inside the wolf. This light grew and grew until it was a blinding blue orb in front of the wolf|Meanwhile, next to them on Three, a huge giant 'popped' in, and the two youngsters scrambled to politely get out of his way.
"Be you Mary of Joanne Village?" asked a shrill, piping voice that must have come from a nearby rabbit, which was a bit curious, as rabbits of course don't talk, or even path. 
"Yes, that's me!" replied Mary, much more amazed by the fact that anyone at the Council Grounds knew her name than she was to be carrying on a conversation with a rabbit|"Connor's a little boy who wants a daddy," she said, lifting one shoulder in a casual shrug. "He's had fun with you. It's only natural he'd start to think of you in that way."

Didn't seem to be bothering her as much as it was bothering him, Griffin thought.

"I didn't mean to-"

"I know that, Griffin|This series is not high on my priority reading list, but I will probably pick up book one sometime in the future!

Do you have a new book coming out and want us to advertise its release?  Are you a publisher and want to advertise your company?  Then look no further!  Here at Literary Lunes, we now offer low-cost, wallet-friendly advertising|Several also had numbers next to them indicating the extra quantities Lystus had purchased.
"Was this delivered somewhere? I can't tell by the invoice," said Gaent.
The stock boy took the invoice from Teria and glanced at it. "It was picked up. It probably would have taken two trips."
"Or one trip if Lystus had brought a friend," said Gaent|I would have loved to have that on video.”
	The kids laughed as Travis mimicked Justin’s reaction. They walked to a nearby cart and bought Dizzy a bottle of water. He was feeling better. A combination of getting the next clue, humiliating Justin, and talking to Megan all helped.
	Travis opened up the photos on his phone and scrolled through them, looking for the picture of the last clue|Why can't the bird see the way out?

"Who's Echo?" asks Ryan.

"But the bird..." I say, ignoring his question.

"Doesn't understand you're trying to help. If anything, it sees you as a threat. Now, tell me, who's Echo|I’d lost him again. I went ahead and bought the ornament and we moved on. Between that booth and the next one was another alley that stretched out lengthwise and was similar to a midway at the fair. 

“Let’s play a game,” I said. 

He pulled his brows together in the middle and said, “A game|"Yes, very well done, brother dear." Ainsley came out of the crowd, her little girl, Gavina, on her arm. She kissed Elliot's cheek. "Juliana will be pleased."

"'Tis what he's hoping." Daniel chortled.

Elliot secured the lid on the box of coins and handed it to Ainsley|“Junior?” Matthias said.
Constance stared at him. The stillness in the hall became palpable as the councilmen, each of them frozen, also stared at Matthias, and then their eyes and heads gradually turned to the princess, over in her humble stall.
Junior.
Constance took a step forward, coming to the edge of her stall|“Of course, Sabrina. That’s fine, I’ll go to bed early, rest up for tomorrow.”
“Tomorrow show you Tokyo, you no can meet the Shinkansen people until next day after, so only play tomorrow, that okay with you?” She asked.
“I think I can live with that, Sabrina|Lestat was sleeping kind of in this chapel in this old convent...."

"I remember from the books," said Antoine.

"Yeah, well, it was Armand who cleared the town. Antoine, please don't go there. He'll blast you right off the face of the Earth."

"I have to go," said Antoine|The head judge said slowly, "Yes, the defendants are on trial for treason."

Nerissa stared at an empty spot on the wall for a moment, then shook her head. "Forgive me. I have only just awoken."

"Do you wish us to begin the proceedings again?" asked the head judge.

"Oh, no, please continue," said Nerissa|“I am surprised you remember that thug. You were pretty drunk the night you met him,” said Zoe sarcastically.
“I’m quitting,” said Ana. “There won’t be any more alcohol.”
“So you say,” said Zoe.
“Come back home and watch me,” said Ana|Nike coughed, Frill gave a hiss of surprise when Ripred trod on her tail, Gregor's stomach rumbled with hunger. But the Vineyard of Eyes drank in their sounds and gave them nothing in return. It was very creepy. They had been walking for about five minutes when Gregor began to see them. The eyes. At first he mistook them for flowers or some of the enticing fruit that hung from the vines|"I shouldn't have to, Drew. You're not this guy. Come on."

"What if I am? I thought you liked 'this guy'?"

"I liked you just the way you were."

"Just not enough."

"I can't help the way I feel, Drew|"I'd like to hear more about teleportation," her dad continued. "How far can you travel?"

She sat up, anxious to hear his answer.

"I can go anywhere in the world," Gregori replied. "But it has to be nighttime wherever I'm going."

Abigail's dad exchanged a look with her, then turned back to Gregori|In high school I had taken all the AP courses I could, while Jessi had taken only the classes she was required to in order to graduate.

"Oh, by the way who is your friend here, Kels?" Caught up in the distraction of class talk, I'd totally forgotten to introduce Kane.

"Um"-I cleared my throat-"This is Kane. Kane, this is my best friend, Jessi|London, and the mess of her own life, seemed blissfully far away.

"Why don't you show those paintings?" Alice asked, at last, when they were lying side by side. "The angry ones, I mean. I think they're beautiful. Vaguely disturbing," she added with a wry laugh, "but beautiful|Within just a few minutes they were back onto Vine Street, it was a little easier now as he was getting to know this part of the town quite well. The Red Sudan pulled into the forecourt of the Professor Pittewurst’s Inn and parked. Brad drove passed and a little further down the Street and parked. He took his time in locking the car and walking back to the Inn|Irulan's father has been putting his legions through landing maneuvers."

Irulan found something of interest in the palm of her left hand. A pulse throbbed at her neck.

"Irulan," Paul asked, "do you persist in arguing that your father's one legion is nothing more than a toy?"

"What could he do with only one legion|"Her grief," said Logan, hoping Nicholas would understand and take his side if they came to blows. Which was a definite possibility.

"Ah," said Nicholas. "So that's what you were doing."

"It's incredibly dangerous," explained Tynan. "And foolish. The woman would have healed on her own. Eventually."

"I don't know," said Nicholas|The cat mewed.
“Did you hear that, Juniper?” Elijah smiled. “You’re gonna be good as new. Annie’ll fix you right up. You got to get better. It’d be too lonely at my house without you.”
“Your house doesn’t have to be so lonely|Only because I ran into Mrs Harris. Literally, I bumped into her because she was standing still in the middle of the sidewalk, looking at the lighthouse on the hill. I was about to mumble something ungracious and continue on past when she grabbed my shoulder tightly. “Ella, look!” she said, gripping me painfully as she pointed at the lighthouse|Frank, who’d been looking ahead while he walked stopped and took a small pair of Bushnell binoculars from the outside pocket of his suit.  He looked through the glasses, focusing on a man standing by a small brown tent just inside the forest. He passed the glasses to Bobby who had a look.
“That looks like your boy the tow truck driver, doesn’t it Bobby|The school didn't expect to see me again until after Christmas, which was fine with me. So, I spent my afternoons like this; sipping hot liquid with an old lady.

"The prophecy," she said.

I leaned back into my chair. "I hadn't thought about the prophecy|We walked into the living room, where Carley had pushed herself up onto the sofa and pulled her robe tighter. “Hey, Susan,” she said.
“Hi! Oh, are you getting ready for the party? I’m so excited,” Susan gushed, sitting down in one of the chairs. Carley shut the TV off. 
“Yeah, so are we,” said Carley|I will not allow them to fall into the hands of the Church of Rome. I will take them to Iona. 
"That will take some time to arrange and I am mindful that not all the monks at Lindisfarne view the Celtic Church as we do. They may try to disrupt or delay our labors. 
"Therefore I have decided to remove the most valuable codex this very evening, before anyone is aware of my plan to go to Iona|He went back to his room, where Earl was packing all his stuff into his trunks. The warrior looked up with a faint look of hope, but Dagdron just sat down on his bed.
“Earl, do you know anything about magic?” Dagdron asked.
“Oh, Dagdron, don’t ask me about that. We’ve seen over the past couple of days that I have no sneaking skills and my brain definitely isn’t smart enough to understand magic|"That's why you need to come to France with me," he said, blazing a fiery trail of kisses across her cheek and to her neck. "Just imagine..." he whispered, "I would make love to you every day."

Tasha let out a deep sigh. "You sure know how to tempt a girl."

"Then come with me."

"Maybe I could get a job in France|“The inscription reads; ‘here lies Macularta he was a good priest to William Haleton.’”
“We’ve hit the jackpot,” announced Haleton.
Amber lowered her voice to a decibel above a whisper. “It looks like we might have to dig into the coffin to find the scroll. Let’s hope it’s still inside and hasn’t been stolen or worse, Rose-a-lee forgot to place it in Macularta’s coffin|The bill was only $30," she reminded him.
"That's okay, it's better to be generous. People are nicer to you that way," he said, as he shrugged his shoulders. 
Emma was amazed again. Who was this guy? Tall, dark, handsome, fast, strong, and generous|Riley noticed her expression and offered her a half smile. "Sorry. I'll make it quick and painless, okay?"

"You shouldn't threaten," she said. Rather than fear, he heard anger in her voice. A whole lot of anger. So why was she looking at Victoria now, rather than Riley|“In truth, Ananda, only the being himself, or herself, can wake the being—and only from within.
“Men’s laws are like walls or fences which contain the herd, and keep it from straying. They are like the banks or levees of a river to guide its course or prevent its overflowing.”
“We have many rules for the Sangha,” said Ananda|I have to get Logan to the cave, I don’t have time to deal with this right now.
“Why are you surprised?” Logan asks, keeping his eyes on the parking lot. Searching for Ryan.
“I didn’t ask him to come here. I want to get to the cave, just like you.”
His shoulders tense, gaze focused on the other side of the lot|How Gavan had swung getting Dylan into the ring against him, Spike didn't know. But if Dylan went down under Spike, that would send a signal to Shiftertown that the Morrisseys could lose strength.

Out of the corner of his eye, Spike saw Connor Morrissey approach Myka. Gavan shot Connor a suspicious look then moved his focus back to the ring|She looked like a thundercloud about to burst, but when she saw Holt she calmed down a little. He ushered her inside and said, “How are you?” 
“I’m fine,” she answered; now she was outright smiling. “Just came to see Nick.”
“He should be alright now,” said Holt|He gripped the wall with his hands, and lashed out with both feet, and struck the projecting edge of the metal. He'd balanced it just so, and he'd been unsure it would even hold the heavy man's weight. Now, as he kicked it with both feet, it slid aside, and tumbled into the dumpster.
The fat man in the sweat soaked overalls had time to gape at Soro, unbridled horror on his slack face, and then he slid down the falling metal sheet, into the yawning mouth of the dumpster|Every step he takes toward me brings him into sharper focus, and I find myself noticing each detail that reminds me of Paul in Russia, and each one that makes them different.

He speaks first. "Thank you for coming here. For trusting me."

I still can't get over seeing him alive again. "How-how did you get out of Russia|I’ve been out most of the morning; only got home ten minutes ago.” 
“I see. Well, just remember that you should call me first if you have any problems; it’s in the lease. You know what I mean?” She winked at him.
Henry didn’t remember exactly what was in the lease|He exhaled to calm himself, kissing Zane again as Zane finally straightened up and loosened his hold. They both knew thirty minutes wasn't enough time.

"Zane?" Ty said, voice more serious. "What do you plan to tell your family about us?"

Zane stared out the bank of windows for a few moments before looking back at Ty|Before I'd come over here, I had packed everything I'd brought from Minnesota back into my backpack, and put it in the tiny backseat. Tonight I was staying at Jeremy's, and in the morning I was doing some wrap-up stuff with Baby and a couple of interviews with some magazines. And then - I didn't even know.

I didn't want to go back to Minnesota|I immediately jumped into action before the arguments could start. I produced Tatiana's note, reading it aloud and then letting Dimitri look at it. I told them about my ghostly encounter, where the queen's troubled spirit made me believe there was truth to this. Nonetheless, my companions were skeptical.

"You have no proof Tatiana wrote the note,' said Dimitri|said Luxa.

"Your sister, Overlander, is about to be torn apart by cutters," said Ripred. "And I need you on Nike, Your Highness. Your bond is in no condition for battle."

"Battle?" said Gregor numbly. "The ants are here for a battle|She had been glancing around the room, but there was

nothing suspicious to see except the unusual clutter-the curtains hung motionless over the shut window;

the pile of bedding on the floor was still. Now she turned to face Jez again. "You didn't call to say you

I need to know where you go after school, Jez|He looked at her with surprise, and his facial expression made her laugh even more. “Call me when you are ready to hang out, okay?” Amber turned around to walk away. Benjamin stood paralyzed and watched her leave until his parents bombarded him with questions and led him to the house. One quick shower, one quick parental update, and three of his mom’s sandwiches later, Benjamin was out the door to see Amber|"Angelica called Silas, who called Gabriel.... Your parents are in Omaha. They want you to go back, they're waiting for you."

I sat in stunned silence for a few minutes, staring past Jericho at a spot on the wall I wasn't really seeing. I had been thinking about going back to Omaha|As he entered and walked to their table his excitement was quelled by the absence of people at the table.
“Where’s my parents,” Jay asked as he approached Michele and her mom who were sitting alone.
Michele got up to give him a congratulatory hug but could tell that he was not a happy person.
“Sit down Jay and we’ll tell you the story,” said Patty as she pulled out the chair between her and Michele|He’s never seen one like this since there aren’t many robots left. The Terrains are considered the ultimate achievement in robotics, why would anyone want the others around?

He flipped the switch on and the lights in his eyes being to turn on. “Good morning!” it exclaimed.

Jacob and Jeremy laughed for it was not morning|Between losing Pandora and Luxa, whom he'd only just found, really, and the responsibility of a kingdom hanging over him - he was clearly overwhelmed. "I do not know what to do. Andromeda, what say you?"

"I will not fight the Overlander and risk injuring him. I am taking Mareth home," said Andromeda|My right hand goes unconsciously to my left wrist, rubbing it, retracing the area that was once, three months ago, bruised from being forced down to the ground, pinned between the dirt and a man who reveled in the evil he committed.

Dad wraps his arm around me. "The shipborns," he begins gently, "they're different from what I expected."

"They're different from what I expected too|“It says ‘Uncle Nick, I don’t want to be taken away, please come and … yeeeoooow.’ That’s all, except there is the sound of a woman’s voice in the background, obviously shouting at him. The phone seems to have been grabbed from him, as the boy can be heard crying out.
“This is a bit upsetting for all of us, but must be especially so for you, Nick|I leaned back against the wall and dug in my jacket pocket for a cigarette.  My hands shook as I lit up and blew the smoke in Jay’s face.  He was in my personal space and he deserved it.  He gave a disgusted cough and backed-up.  Under normal circumstances he would have started in on me about my smoking|With luck, the incoming text message might be information that would grant Trish a reprieve from this distasteful task. She waited as Katherine fished the iPhone from her lab coat's pocket and eyed the screen.

Katherine Solomon felt a wave of relief to see the name on her iPhone.

At last.

PETER SOLOMON

"It's a text message from my brother," she said, glancing over at Trish|asked Dormer.
“Never seen her,” said Adsen. “Never heard of her. Alistair must have picked her up after the medical facility was destroyed, or else she’s lying about working for him.”
“Why would she lie?” asked Dormer.
“Any number of reasons,” said Adsen|The following morning, after a hearty full English breakfast that Ced demolished while the landlady of the B&B looked on in rapture, they took a walk around the village to check if the gallery had opened. They were about a hundred yards away when they saw an ageing Volvo draw up outside the gallery. John Andrews got out of the passenger side, waved to Lola as she drove off and unlocked the gallery door.
“That was close,” whispered Ced. “If we’d been a couple of minutes earlier, we’d have been right outside the gallery|I had to remind myself that he had been unconscious back at the outpost. He had undergone emergency surgery to remove a bullet from his chest. He was obviously not fully recovered.
He continued to search the pockets of the dead soldier, picking him clean. In the soldier’s vest he found a couple of energy bars.
“Here, eat this,” he said as he handed me one of the bars|Having meetings in the Queen of Scots had seemed such a reasonable thing to do – it hadn’t occurred to him before that having a few drinks could be misinterpreted, or indeed that anyone was keeping track of this expenditure. After all, people couldn't be expected to turn up at meetings at all without an incentive. It was all quite harmless, and they did stick to the agenda and have minutes. Or did they?
'I thought you were meant to be the secretary|"Mostly up and about as well. Demoux is among the last batch. A few more days, and the army will be back to full strength."

Minus those who died, Elend thought.

Cett eyed Demoux. "Most of the men recovered weeks ago. A bit weaker in the constitution than one might expect, eh, Demoux|"Yes sir, she's very beautiful." I glared at Connor and then smiled at the bellhop.

"Darling husband, make sure you tip this nice young man well."

He pulled out a wad of money from his pocket and started thumbing through the bills. I walked over to him and grabbed a hundred-dollar bill and handed it to the bellhop|It feels so complicated, seeing her."

"She's a person, not a jigsaw puzzle. Go see her. She'd love to see you. What about Bowditch Bridge? Have you been there?"

Bowditch Bridge. Even the name made me think of a blade, recarving my scars. "I'd definitely brave seeing Birdie before I went back to the bridge|I imagine there are other ways to do it but I've never investigated any. Crystals work for me so I use them.”
“There are other ways we know of but crystals are in the top three for efficiency of storage.”
“What other ways?”
“We have constructed batteries that will store magic. Depending on what materials they are made of they can be better than crystals|"So what have you found out?" Gaent asked.
Nero put out both hands in front of him, fingers wide. "Nothing," he pronounced.
"You were always a good investigator," said Gaent. "I don't believe it's nothing."
"Maybe I've lost my touch," said Nero|It was a peculiar noise, like one of those water-warblers people make bird noises with. "I'm afraid I can't tell you precisely where the Sage is," the voice out of nowhere said. "You have to find him for yourself. Think about it, child-of-a-god. You must have noticed there's a pattern."

"Too right, there's a pattern|It should have been coy; it should have had many strange pauses and moments of double meaning. Instead Camille was acting like she'd just seen Magnus yesterday. Like they were simply friends. It was enough of an entry to allow him to get to the point.

"I'm here because there's a problem, Camille|"Ma, stop."

"Don't protect him, Tristan." She looks down at the beer can in my hand, then shakes her head in disgust. "Caleb, please leave my house."

I put the unopened can down on the table. Mrs. Norris doesn't even look at the can|When you try to understand what made people willing to sacrifice so many lives you just end up with a convoluted, mixed-up mess of a story. Look at Lee, a man who apparently didn’t believe in slavery, serving out of loyalty as the commanding general of the South. I suppose that when he sorted things out, his feelings about slavery weren’t as strong as the loyal feelings he had for the South|* * * * * *



Epilogue Two Nights Later

TRENT

From high above, perched on the thick branch of a tree, I watched the cars below passed by. They were the only things on the streets at the moment. It was nights like these that I wished something would happen. It was too quiet, too peaceful, too… boring|Godric did not budge until he finished his own meal. Then he told Edric to find some honey. They carried it to Dudda and smeared it over the angry injury.
Dudda watched them with teary eyes, fearful yet desperate to trust them. “What did you do to me?”
“I did my best to heal you,” said Godric|I just haven't thought about it."

"Were you not going to attend? You were a hit at the last one."

"Yes. With my psychohistory. Some hit."

"You attracted the attention of the Emperor. No other mathematician did."

"It was you who were initially attracted, not the Emperor|I yelled. Instantly, the pain spread to my throat, making me quite unable to speak. It didn't matter, though, Holly heard me, and turned toward me. Some of the pain that had clouded her eyes left.
"Evanna," she said. "Wh-"
"You have to do it, Holly|He was about to wave it away and buy something else when Ellie stepped up beside him.

"Can I ask you one more question?" she said. "Just for research purposes?"

The woman nodded, chewing her lip.

"Have you ever even heard of a whoopie pie?"

"I don't-" she began, then looked at Graham, who raised his chin up and down almost imperceptibly, and the cashier's eyes drifted back to Ellie|"I was wondering, Mr. Innis, is there someone who could watch your daughter for a little while?" Will had been leaning on the fence. Now he turned and faced the detective. His head wasn't clear. It took a moment to locate the exact words he wanted.

"Why would she need to be watched|Annabelle seized hold of Dani's hands, flashing her radiant, loving smile. "And who are you?"

Dani studied her for a moment, managing a wan smile. "Danielle," she said softly. "But you can call me Dani."

"It's a pleasure to meet you Dani|Robert, perhaps we should call it a day.  I'm sure Dr. Rider can ask the nurse to give you something to help you sleep."
Dr. Pazzo laughed bitterly.  "Why should I get to sleep peacefully Frank?  When everyone else is troubled.  I know how rare sedatives are these days.  Since I am the author of all this," he raised his hands and spread his arms around him, "why should I be the one that sleeps|“Most people don’t, but I won’t take it personally.”
A door squeaked open and slammed against a wall at the far end of the corridor, followed by footsteps advancing toward her cell. Emma, jerked back to the reality of imprisonment, stiffened with apprehension.
“David?” she whispered.
“Stay calm and don’t speak to the guard, Emma|Whether it was her obvious enmity for him, or her sheer hardheadedness, he wasn't sure. But there was something about Bella that got to him. Felt somehow...familiar.

Jesse pulled in a deep breath, leaned both hands on the counter and looked at her. "It's just some walls and windows, Ms. Cruz-or can I call you Bella|Laurence slowly went to him; he felt uncertain-what could one say, to a dragon? He had no orders to give. But Temeraire's head lifted and turned to meet him, something half-hopeful and wary in his looks; Laurence said, "If you are not otherwise occupied, may I bear you company?"

"Oh!" Temeraire said, "as though you had to ask, Laurence|I saw all the commotion in the hall a minute ago.” Holly glances from Becca to me. “I don’t know why she acts like that. She’s definitely starting to get on people’s nerves on the squad, and it’s only gotten worse since she’s become captain.”
“Yeah, about that,” I frown, “Why aren’t you captain|Finally, she bought him shoes with a Velcro closure, and what had once been such a struggle, became a somewhat simple task.  Now all she had to worry about was him chewing on the Velcro. When you solve one problem, there is always another one right behind it. Progress, Willow knew from experience, seemed to be the ability to solve an endless supply of problems.
Tommy stood up, his shoes on the wrong feet and looked up at Willow|"I have enough to worry about and so does my son, without either of us having to worry about you."

Well, Fiona had to admit, that was true enough.

The color went out of Bella's cheeks again and Fiona reckoned Bella agreed.

"Go to bed," Prentice repeated.

Bella looked to the oven, her shoulders fell then she looked back at Prentice|The door of the study opened straight onto the terrace. Von Bork pushed it back, and, leading the way, he clicked the switch of the electric light. He then closed the door behind the bulky form which followed him and carefully adjusted the heavy curtain over the latticed window. Only when all these precautions had been taken and tested did he turn his sunburned aquiline face to his guest|Breathless, she dropped back against her pillows.

He was at the side of the bed in an instant. "Are you all right? Do you need a nurse?"

"I'm fine," she lied tightly as the pain began to ebb into a just barely tolerable ache. "And no, I don't need a nurse|pulled out my place card from the dinner. “want to tell me what this says, Nicky?” i stretched my arm across the table, let him have a look. “hmm?”
“head table,” Nick said.
“yeah,” i threw it in his face. “maybe next time you pick something a little less misleading for those of us who have nothing else to live for…”
and with another toast, it was signed into law, just as Kayla sat down next to Nick|Haven’t been able to party like this for two years.  Know any risky ways to have some fun around here?”
The first thing she ever said to him was in reply to his ridiculous introduction.  “Well, first, only morons take risks,” she said.  “And, second, I don’t talk to morons|“I will make sure Zoe sees this,” said Ana.
“Well, I should say goodbye, too,” said McKenzie. “I’ve got some more details to wrap up for this case.”
“I totally underestimated you,” said Ana.
“Too late, you had your pick, and you went for the nerdy professor,” said McKenzie|She put the bottle back on the shelf, and grabbed a bottle of gray salt instead.

"Why gray instead of pink?"

Scout shrugged and moved over to the next bank of shelves, which held old coins and metal knickknacks. "It's my go-to shade."

"Veronica has lip stain; you have salt|Ribb tried to ignore his daughter and kept his eyes fixed on Ruby.
‘She looks like a…’ He managed to stop himself just in time. His daughter was going to a teenage disco, yet she looked as if she was about to set up business in the Wallen.
‘She's only going to a disco|I raked my hands over my face, trying to wake myself. Two officers stood just outside Melanie's room, talking quietly as I approached them. "I'm Daniel Montgomery. You needed to speak with me?"

"We need to ask you a couple of questions." I answered each of their questions as honestly and as straightforwardly as I could, feeling only slightly uncomfortable when they asked about my relationship with Melanie|“Well now,” Mr. Pegg said.. “I’m glad we got all of that business taken care of. Let’s get to those prizes.” He reached into his briefcase and took out four silver plastic cards. He set the cards down on the table in front of them with care.
	“Wow,” Ana said, staring at the cards|"I'm not looking forward to the hit my department will take when the media finds out we have no suspects."
<><><>


At the interstate rest stop, Anne stepped out of Hank’s truck, pulled off the black baseball cap, and shook her now-blonde waves.
“Seems odd seeing you in blonde hair,” said Hank|Silence filled the air as he weighed the decision before him. He let go of Claudia, stepping away from the vampire. "Do as she says, Claudia."

"What?!" Claudia spat. "You forget who you've sworn to protect, prince."

"I never swore to protect you, Claudia|"We shall depart from the river in one hour. Gregor, you must go to the armory to prepare," Solovet said.

One hour? Was that all that was left? "I'll dress. on the trip. I want to be with my sisters," said Gregor.

"They will be accompanying us," said Solovet|Buck took a pocket calculator out of a drawer and began punching in numbers and mumbling to himself. "Four hundred miles round trip. Gear rental for two nights. Three people. Guided? Unguided?"

"Just the three of us."

"You're looking at around three thousand."

Kalyn glanced at Will. He nodded, mouthed "I can cover it," then turned back to Buck|‘From Earth’s viewpoint, you yourself represent a serious threat to the safety and smooth running of our empire. Seven further versions of you make it imperative that preventive action be taken.’
‘OK.’
Debois hesitated.
‘We have already disposed of one of those seven; Number Six. We need you to finish the job and deal with the other six|“W’at ’bout da kitchen?” Arlette asked. “Why kan’t we stay dere?”
“Two a da veterans will take care a da backyard,” David said.
“Why? Da Klan’s ridin’ in da front,” Lucille said, a bite in her voice.
“If you two’d listen once in a while, you’d be knowin’,” David said and glared at Arlette|The digital clock chimed at seven p.m. by the time I finished with work, and I was all alone in the office since George had already left an hour earlier. I stretched my arms over my head slowly and leisurely, savoring the release of tension from my muscles and joints.

Constantijin hadn't called me for, like, hours|And you can bring home some candles from the mine tomorrow. That’ll be a saving. Everyone uses them. Pink they are.’
Archie was taken aback. ‘Surely that’s stealing,’ he said.
‘Surely you’re right,’ she agreed.
Archie crinkled his brow. The daughter of the mine manager was telling him to steal the company’s candles|I plan on staying with Corbin for a couple more months, but it wouldn’t hurt to have an idea of what I’ll want for my own place when I do finally move out. I’m hoping it’ll be just as easy to shop when that time comes as it was for Miles today.

“I’ve never seen anyone shop this fast,” I tell him.

“Disappointed?”

I quickly shake my head. If there’s one thing I don’t do well as a girl, it’s shop|"Why kids?" Max said. "We're all addicted to those things."

"Not me," Loralei said.

Carl huffed. "Right. Your hands are on your iPhone more than they're on me." He looked around at all of us. "Why do you think we don't have kids|Even though I had an ample amount of time to decide, I was torn over which direction to take my life. Thinking of everything that Jack had sacrificed for Alanna, willingly, without complaint, made it feel a little selfish to me to do anything other than give Teren exactly what he wanted.

But I couldn't really compare the situation. Jack may have had no better option to him than his life with Alanna|Montrose made his way back to the front door, blocking blow after the blow from the battle-crazed man in front of him. He stumbled backwards out the inn door, then tripped down the stone steps of the tavern and fell onto his back in the muddy street. For a brief, terrifying moment he thought his attacker might follow him, but he saw a dark whirl of the man’s cloak just inside the door as his opponent turned back into the inn|Maybe it just seems that the older they are, the more experience they should have. Or at least that's my way of thinking.

"Where were you bitten?" This comes from paramedic number one, on my left.

"The back of my left knee."

He nods to paramedic number two, who begins placing a cuff around my arm as paramedic number one lifts my leg to examine the bite|There were a few other cars in the parking lot. I was hoping there wouldn't be unsuspecting visitors caught up in this, but it was too late to worry. Everybody was in the crossfire now. Six billion potential innocent bystanders.

I took the steep stairs toward the chapel at a run.

Sweat dried on my skin as I pounded up the steps, and I was about halfway up when I realized that somebody was right behind me, and gaining|The Director jumped up, went to a counter, handed over a ten, and brought back a plate of red velvet cakes. He put them in front of Rusty, whose eyes widened with pleasure. She grabbed one in a napkin and began dunking it into her bowl of coffee.
Danish shook his head and grinned at the Director|He felt a little weak in the knees, but managed to gather the necessary courage.
“Ana, did you enjoy the evening?” said Vo. He left his shoes at the bar, and was making little splashes of water with his foot. 
“Yes. I’m almost hoping that it won’t end,” said Ana|Rather, everything is stopped on a gasp. And for the first time in my life, for as long as I can remember, when backed into a corner, I take a leap. Instead of running or evading or lying, I take a leap and I trust.

I don't know why I leap, why I trust|I was on National Forest land, so the call likely would have been transferred to the ranger station since it is in their jurisdiction.  But I ended up talking to Deputy Powell in Willow Run.  Did a ranger defer to the Willow Run cops?  I found it surprising that a federal agency would give up jurisdiction on anything to anyone, especially a small-town police department.  Once US government agencies were on a case, they seemed unlikely to give it up to the locals|Believe me, I've tried, but every time I think I've got a handle on my heart, you pop up again."

"I will work on that. I will try to stay out of your barn," I promise.

"No," he says. "I don't want you to stay out of my barn|Tony the Tiger rubbed along her leg in the threshold of the spare room’s door while she looked at the two boys. 
 “I know, you want to play, don’t you?” She picked up the kitten and walked over to the bed, setting him down and gently stirring the boys awake.
“Aunt Dia, stop licking me” Daman said. Leon mumbled in reply, “Dummy that’s the cat|'Yes,' said Conina.

'No,' said Nijel.

He was trembling with rage, or possibly with cold, and was nearly as pale as the glaciers that rumbled past below them.

Conina sighed. 'Well, just how do you think-' she began.

'Take me down somewhere a few minutes ahead of them,' said Nijel|"I got over it, Neely, finally."

"Maybe I haven't."

"Oh get a life! And grow up while you're at it. You're not the football hero anymore."

"There you go. That's what I want to hear. Unload with both barrels."

"Did you come here to fight, Neely|“We can go then?” Star said. 
“Okay,” Winston said, “you’re on.”
Star bowed and swept her hand forward. “After you, my – ”
“Oh, no,” Winston interrupted. “After you, my heroine.”
“I love it when you talk like that, Winston|Absalom longed for it all to go away. Yet, it was he that had instigated the whole affair. Therefore, he was forced to keep reassuring himself that, once the crown was upon his own head, it would be worth the negative and distasteful conniving that had taken place!
Some men are made to grasp and wrangle for power, and such was the case of Absalom|She glanced up at Aaron, and blushed when she saw he was watching her intently. “I’m sorry, I’m being absurd!”
“No,” replied Aaron emphatically. “Never apologize for your thoughts, my sweet. I love the fact that you are so curious. Maybe one day we can follow those water droplets and discover where the river takes them,”
“Really, Aaron|I analyze my emotions; confusion, inquisitiveness and eagerness are flowing inside me, causing chaos. Fear is absent, though. "I think I'm good. Although, I'm confused."

He scratches his head like it's the weirdest response he's ever heard. "Alright then, lie down and I'll do my best to eliminate some of the confusion|They were curled up at the far end of the container. They were wearing black. They hadn’t moved or said a word since we had been locked up. And they were barely breathing. If he hadn’t coughed, we would never have even known he was there.
Maria and I moved back and away from the person who had coughed|Neither Anna nor Father would ever venture beyond the prescribed social parameters to converse with each other, as long as she was out of sight and not seen alone by either of them she would have the day to herself. Her only concern was covering her tracks afterwards, but those details could be dealt with later in the day, once the sun was directly overhead and it was too hot to walk, to explore, and to experience this rare freedom.
At the top of the hill she turned the corner quickly, taking a side street which wound through the back of her neighborhood|He had me compose a letter to be circulated among the Greeks of the entire world, that they are now completely free of Persian rul
Alexander did not tarry long in Susa, but was anxious to capture Darius’ ceremonial capital at Persepolis. In midwinter he crossed the mountains and seized the capital so unexpectedly that the Persians did not have time to hide the royal treasury. The treasure he collected was so vast, that it took twenty thousand mules and five thousand camels to remove it.
As Alexander approached Persepolis, they came upon a hundred Greeks, who had been captured by the Persians|“Conrad, what a surprise,” he said, but he didn’t sound surprised at all. “Speaking of surprises, I have one for you too.”
“Oh really? What is it?”
“You’ve moved.”
“Barry… I haven’t moved.”
“I’m not going to argue with you, Conrad|*
Julia opened the door to Lizzie’s room and found her little girl listening to Mary read her The Poky Little Puppy. 
She went over to them and sat next to them on the bed. “Listen, Honey, I want you to go out with me, for a walk. Okay?”
Lizzie looked at Mary, but Mary was looking at Julia|"There are sensors attached to the doors and windows," said the mugger. "Look I've got to get out of here, they could be here any moment."
"Who could be here any moment?" asked Michael.
"My boss or one of his associates.  He doesn't take failure lightly.  The job has to be completed within a certain amount of time," said the mugger|"He says he trusts you."

A pause followed that Luce refused to fill. She wanted to leave. What if Daniel looked over and saw her in this dim cave with Cam? They were arguing, but Daniel wouldn't be able to tell that from a distance. What did they look like, she and Cam|I jerked my head in their direction.

"Tell me why I shouldn't wake them?" I whispered. "Tell me why I shouldn't push that?"

I pointed to the panic button on the wall.

He smiled. "Now, where would be the fun in that?"

"Zach," I hissed, and let my hand creep closer to the button|I'm barely aware of the salty, spicy, slimy oyster sliding down my throat. All I feel is the heat of Jet's gaze. I lick my lips and Jet does the same, as though he's wishing he could taste mine instead.

Finally his eyes rise to mine. "Good?"

"Delicious," I respond, not in any way referring to the oyster|Gina and Derrick refused to come to the party themselves because they thought they wouldn’t want me to throw the same kind of party if they were away on vacation. Kevin hadn’t shown up yet. I wondered if he ever would show up. I knew that I would be disappointed if he didn’t. It was a minute to midnight and the DJ stopped the music to announce the New Year. I scanned the crowd to see if I could find Kevin|When we take him down, no matter how natural his death appears, there will be an investigation."

"He the one after Kane and Brian?" Javier asked, bringing his travel mug to his mouth. The hot coffee warmed his insides. There was malice in his voice.

"Jefferson has a hard-on for both of them," Mack said. "Sergeant Major turned his report over to General Chilton and I'm guessing Chilton turned it over to Jefferson|It was the book he'd wanted to steal from Nalizar, the one the professor had borrowed a few weeks back.

"You stole it?" Joel asked with a hushed tone.

"Hardly," Melody said, walking down the slope with her stack of books. "He told me to return these to the library as if I were some glorified errand girl."

"Uh ... that's what you are, Melody|“But both our jugs for water lay full just there,” said Jayden. “What was she doing in those woods?”
“It matters not!” Jamison said his voice near screaming. “My sister is dying and I have no way of helping her.”
“Why did you tie her to the tree then? Your actions have no sense, Jamison,” said Jayden|(On the other hand, he’s got a spear and we haven’t.) Finally, he taps his chest.
“Pullawarra,” he says. He points to us. “Binjin.”
He repeats the words. Then he spins around and suddenly he’s gone.
Seconds later he reappears with a handful of sarsaparilla berries. He puts them on the ground, steps back and points to us and the berries|Violet caught me in a giant hug, laughing hysterically as she wrestled for the hose. Once we were both drenched and soapy, we sat on the floor of the tank giggling.

The loud roar of a motorcycle reverberated through the concrete walls, making us look at each other in interest.

"No way." Violet scrambled to her feet and peeked out of the tank|He was so angry that the guys with him were turning to see what he was staring at. In fact, it seemed Kimber and Sam were attracting quite an audience. Unfortunately for Kimber, one of her audience members stepped forward, making a beeline for the pair.

Jenna looked like a woman with a mission and by the evil glint in her eye, whatever that mission was would not be good for Kimber|“Darlings, it’s nearly midnight. You should go to bed now.” 
“Mom, I’m working on my science fair project for Mr. Tesla. Declan is helping me. Can we stay up since it is Saturday night?” 
Mrs. Salk gave in. “Oh, I guess that will be fine, darling|Caelen rolled his eyes while Alaric looked bored. Ewan gestured her to sit.

She settled down and pressed her hands into a single fist before setting it on the table before her.

"The lass is Mairin Stuart."

She dropped the announcement as if she expected Ewan to react in some way.

"I know the lass's name is Mairin|Yet you chose to stay here, for the baby, but you and I both know there's more to it than that. There's a chemistry between us, sparks."

"Those sparks-" she proceeded warily "-are just a part of our disagreements."

"Disagreements? You've publically denounced my work. That's a little more than a disagreement|How was that even possible, yeah I got jealous when he was talking to Becks. When I am near him my whole body reacts in a weird way, which I don't even understand. He sends my heart racing, my breathing crazy and I loved when his strong arms embraced me. 

I let out a deep breath, was that love|Bridget concentrated on her food, avoiding eye contact. It was painful. Especially when he was so very pleasant to look at. Which, it pained her to admit, came about because of that gym routine she mocked. “Did you drive here?” he asked suddenly.
“I did.”
“Could you give me a lift back to the gym|It took me a minute to find the right room, and when I did it, I found only Von and Catcher sitting in big leather chairs messing around with their instruments. They looked up at me in surprise and I felt my heart trip when I didn't see Jet anywhere.

"Uh, hey."

"Hey," they chorused in unison.

"I'm, uh, looking for Jet|“I thought if I told them we were married, I’d have a better chance of staying with you.”
Anne’s heart squeezed.  There was that protective thing he had going.  She didn’t know whether she should hug him or hit him.
“I’m taking you home,” he commanded.
Before she could object, he lifted her from the bed and placed her on a wheelchair|"Darabont is indeed dead and with her that cursed line." Christian sighed, leaning back with a shrug. "So it looks like you're the best we've got, Dr. Erin Granger. What's the point in second-guessing?"

The coffee finally arrived, allowing them to collect their thoughts.

Once the server was gone, Jordan took a sip, winced at the blistering heat, and nodded to Christian|You laugh and shout: "Kadima, HEY!" 
You love cheering yourself with a "Kadima, Hey!" just as Liora and I do whenever you do something great.
I join you,"Kadima, HEY, Orna! Way to go!" 
Orna claps and says, to me "Kadima, Hey|A cool, dry voice spoke close behind her, a voice that sounded eerily like the observational one inside her own head, the one that told her the uncomfortable truths she didn't want to acknowledge. "Why is it," the voice said, "that you can only love monsters?"

Elena couldn't bring herself to turn around.

"Or is it that only monsters can truly love you, Elena|One of these days he was going to show up on a Calvin Klein billboard. "I had a crush on him when we were thirteen. That was eight years ago."

"But you had a crush on him for years. Years. You were devastated when he moved away."

"And like I said, I was thirteen|Elliot Ravenwood, looking concerned, and a little annoyed by the police presence, slowly walked to the conference room.
"What in the world is going on here?" yelled Ravenwood.  "Your officers have no right tearing apart the offices up here, not at least without a warrant." 
"My officers have every right to be here.  But just to satisfy you, I have a warrant|"I'm too tired to plan."
Frank's grin faded.  "You aren't going alone."
"Let's not worry about it just yet.  I'm sick of being scared."
He gently grabbed her chin and turned her face toward him.  "We don't have to talk about it right now Nella, but you aren't going alone|"We have a chance to do something very special together, Cassie," Jon said as his gaze held hers. "With your brains and my resources, the world could be ours."

No. "I don't want the world. I just want away from you." Because she'd seen, after she'd turned down his proposal, the real Jon|You know, the usual.”
“Give me a description of the field hand you saw with Hank.”
“He looked to be about 5 foot 10 inches and kind of skinny for a guy.  He was wearing a denim barn jacket and a black baseball cap.  He came out of the house with Hank|I don’t know, maybe I thought I was just not... seeing things right.” As Sam speaks, I detect a slight accent but I cannot place it.
I nod. “Why do you think she didn’t pick you?”
“I was sitting with a friend.”
“So, you weren’t alone.”
“Yeah, they only go for people who are alone|“Baby, you’re too young.  This is why I was against sending you to public school.”
“Mother,” I sigh, sitting back down on my bed.  “I’m sixteen.”
“You’re not equipped to make such decisions, though,” she half-whines.  “And we haven’t even had the talk|I expect you've got a Ghost mask somewhere? Mrs Ogg saw you waving it, see. And she's not as gormless as she looks-'

'Thank you,' said a fat ballerina. '-so she thought, how could people still say afterwards that they'd seen the Ghost? 'Cos that's how you recognize the Ghost, by his mask|“Sorry, Dane,” Feredir said in a friendly manner.  “She wants to see you.”
“Not now,” said Dane impatiently.  “I just got another assignment.”
“Yara won’t like that you’ve refused her again.”
“It can’t be helped,” explained Dane|“It’s a crying shame that I have to get back to work soon. I’m about ready to ambush you by the Mission myself…”
They stared at each other, food forgotten.  I love you was right there on the tips of tongues.  Before Scott could go there, Melissa glanced at her watch.
“I do need to go, Scott|I'll pay my rent on time and-"

"I wasn't worried about it, Rachel," he broke in. "I guess you can't tell Teri, can you?"

Now, that was going to be painful. Rachel told Teri everything. She was her closest friend and had been for years. But Nate was right; she couldn't leak a word of this to anyone, not even Teri|"See ya, dude," Caleb tells him.

I grab his arm before he can walk out. "I'm so sorry, Gabe. I appreciate your understanding. Will I...see you soon?"

He touches my face the same way Caleb did the other day. It shocks me frozen. Luckily, I don't break into another make-out dream like I did with Caleb|There was no way I could have known that was her name, I'm convinced of it. And there are dozens of much more common C names for my brain to pluck out at random. So when you said Camille... it freaked me out"

So Camille had managed to find a conduit through Regan's dreams. Or maybe it was Alcroft under the guise of Camille|She smiled up at Andre and then let her gaze journey over to meet her mother's questioning face.

"What, pray tell?" her mother beseeched her.

Tasha looked back at Andre. "James Maurice de Laurent."

"It's perfect." Andre touched the baby's face and then looked back at Tasha|"Watching Rule take such good care of Shaw is kind of hard for me. I never thought he was going to fall in love, never thought anyone would be able to get him to see past himself, but she did, and they are just so perfect together. I thought guys like him-guys like you-were hopeless. Now I'm wondering if I'm the one who is hopeless|The summer break was still months away, but it seemed that the discussion couldn't wait.

"You can't look after Mr. Bean, Caroline! You know perfectly well that your grandmother won't have pets in the house," said Mum. "And Aunt Glenda is allergic."

"But Mr. Bean doesn't have any fur," said Caroline|For example, what’s this about you running for the U.S. Senate next year?”
 	“Oh, you’ve heard about that?”
 	“Steiner half-confirmed the rumour to me.”
 	“He did, the old leech? Well… yes!” he said with sudden bravado. “As a matter of fact, I am running|Ana awoke instantly and dropped the Mickey Mouse doll she was using as her pillow. Dizzy reached over and picked the stuffed animal up and set it back in his sister’s arms.
	“It’s called Bluetooth mom,” Dizzy corrected. “Not Blueteeth.”
	Michelle put her hand over her ear piece and turned back to Dizzy|"Can you imagine what she wants to do to him?" Hannah asked, horrified. "Kendall, you have to keep her away from Rick."

"Oh, I do so enjoy young people." Raina laughed. "Hannah's right. We need to keep Lisa away. I realize I might have encouraged her-before you came to town, you understand,"

she said to Kendall|What do I do, Fang?

It is up to you to make the most of this, Moon Dance, and to help your son make the most of this, too. Think of this as an opportunity, Moon Dance. Not a curse. For both you and your son.

I hung my head for a minute or two, then typed: Thanks for your help, Fang|No-one in attendance expected that reunion, least of all the delusional former friend who was either maintaining an elaborate pretence or had come to believe that she really had lived Cady’s life. Indeed, it was her tearful declaration to Louise that she was her unknown granddaughter that finally ended the mystery of Stella’s disappearance.
“I don’t know if I would have been bold enough to simply tell Louise who I was if she hadn’t tried it first,” says Cady|He entered his pin and was given the option of how much cash he wished to withdraw. Having no idea what things were likely to cost, he opted for the maximum, which was £200. A few seconds later his card was returned and a little metal flap opened, providing him with a mixture of ten and twenty pound notes. He breathed a sigh of relief, placed the card back in his wallet and examined the money|Tasha raked her teeth over the edge of her bottom lip. "Are you sure it's false labor?"

"After last week's humiliation, I'm sure." Camille shook her head. "I won't be sent on that fool's errand again."

"Well sooner or later, it's going to be real labor|"They died good deaths, fighting bravely for the king", Ser Eustace told Dunk, "and I brought them home and buried them among the blackberries". His wife was buried there as well. Whenever the old man breached a new cask of wine, he went down the hill to pour each of his boys a libation. "To the king!" he would call out loudly, just before he drank|After a few minutes, Stephanie stopped screaming and then we got to the clearing. They dragged us from the van and made us sit on this log while they started a fire and stuff. That's when I found out my phone didn't get any reception there."

Decker nodded, recalling her telling him she hadn't been able to get a signal|I told him I just wanted to have a little fun.  I told him you tried to talk me out of it.  I took full responsibility for the entire incident.  I even made a vow to him that if I even stepped out of line, even just a little, I would voluntarily leave the Academy."
"Why didn't you use the incident as your way out of the Academy|“All I can say is I’m glad Paul told me about you, Debbie. I could have interviewed a hundred people and been hard-pressed to find anyone as capable as I’m certain you’re going to be.”
“Why, thank you, boss.”
Adam looked at Debbie with mock consternation. “Now what did I tell you about that, Debbie|He walks over to consult with someone in the booth, keeping an eye on us the entire time.
After five minutes, Zoey starts fidgeting. “What’s taking so long?” She leans between the front seats to look around Dad’s shoulder. “He should be able to check everything on his tablet. It’s like he’s—”
“Hush, Zoey|Loras chose his companions fairly, even when he wanted to take Farah with him. I have no complaints about the process though it left me marching in the rain. Farah pulls up her hood to keep out the damp, and the rest of us follow suit. Vel takes point with the rest of us in twos. Z ends up beside me, Xirol with Farah|Katrine went over to the window in the front room. “They’re still here, Harold.” There was fear in her voice, and I couldn’t help but wonder who “they” were.
“We’ll send her to Grandma Sidney’s.”
“She’s going through a phase right now. At least, I hope it’s a phase|I had a hundred truths. Nothing worked. Charlie believed Jenny Flick.

"But you even know she's a mythomaniac!" I said.

"Stop using those big words. You sound like a f**king geek."

"Maybe I am a f**king geek."

"Maybe you're more than a geek|Vo was lying on his side with his head propped on his elbow, gazing at Ana. For a moment Ana thought that Vo was going to kiss her, but he soon sat up and cast his eyes toward the ocean instead.
“Is it time to go?” said Ana, with a little disappointment in her voice.
“Almost, but we can stay a little longer,” said Vo|“So defenseless and weak. It’s honestly adorable. Who designed this formation? Was it you, Eli? This is what we teach my soldiers not to do when fighting the greatest Lybrian of all time.” 
“You mean Carter-Adrian Nicholas Breese?” Eli snarled. 
“You have a great sense of humor, Eli|“That’s why I asked. Go ahead.” Adam pulled out his notebook and a pen. “I hope you don’t mind my taking notes. If I’m going to write my first blog about Sweetwater, I want to get as much detail as possible.”
“Of course I don’t mind, but I’m not sure you should use what I tell you in the blog|"Do you know I met Mrs. Halifax on Castlehill in Edinburgh just yesterday morn, and she said that you and she had parted company?"

"No," Alistair sighed. Badger had woken with the commotion of course, and the puppy came bumbling over the bed to lick his fingers. "Did she tell you that her name isn't really Halifax|"Because I slept for two straight days," said Howard.

"Oh, man! I was supposed to wake you. Sorry, Ripred sent me down to the prophecy room and I totally forgot," said Gregor.

"Do not trouble yourself. I am practically the only coherent person in the hospital. There should be at least one," said Howard|From the front seat, Roarke groaned. "Good luck, brother of mine."

"Thanks." Aidan glanced at Emma. "Are you coming?"

"What if I don't want to?"

His hand closed over her arm and his golden eyes grew intense. "Get out of the car, Emma|Max stared at Liam for a long moment as if he thought Liam had lost his mind. Then he turned his gaze to Lauren. "Is this true?"

"Yes," she whispered.

"What else did you lie about?" Max asked bluntly. "What did he do to you, Lauren|It can be anywhere from 4% up to 12%, with the average around 6% or 8%. The broker then turns around and shares his or her proceeds with the selling broker, who is the broker representing the buyer. (Confusing, I know.) In a net listing, however, the owner receives a specified — net — amount from the sale, with the excess going to the broker|But some people are born with powers, or magic, or whatever you want to call it. In this corner of the multiverse, time and space powers are the most common."
Carda flipped through the Manual. It had different handwriting every few pages, like a business ledger. "So I was born with these powers?" At least he didn't have to call it magic|Apparently, she had been there the night before with her dad to get a bracelet.  She wanted to return it today.  Her dad has really put his foot down with her.  He won’t pay off her credit card bills anymore.
“We approached the jewelry counter and Pat said, ‘I’d like to return this bracelet.’
“The lady said, ‘Do you have a receipt|“If it gets her back to normal and that murderous Eris out of the city, then fine.”

Dale turned to Richter and held out his hand. “They have seen you survive an arrow to the chest and dragon fire. The people will always see you as a great and powerful man not to be reckoned with.”

Richter slid the pendant over his head and reluctantly handed it to Dale|“Alright, idiot, just get out of our way. Actually,” Meredith stopped, “what is your target?”
Scott put a hand up to his lips. “Bounty hunters don’t share. Plus, this one is way above your station. It’s best for you to return home to your little bar and leave the work up to the real hunters|"Well," said Blake dryly, "I'm at least glad that you got me over the ballerina.  Even if she was the person obviously more capable of being governor."
Trudy and Merv both turned angrily on Blake so fast, it felt like old times.  "That's not true!" they both cried in unison.  Then Trudy said, "Merv may be a lier, but he told the truth when he said you'd make a good governor|“Or stay in, really. I'm getting warm too.”
   “Was there anything under the sticks you set fire to?”
   “Oh, lordy.” Marvin said that quickly as he zipped over and took a closer look at what was burning in the fire. “Henna, there's Upwood in the fire|She couldn't blame Mack for treating her as someone he had to take care of when she didn't act like a partner, but she had stood on her own and she liked herself.

She didn't want to go back.

A tingling awareness crept down the back of her neck and she took a breath.

"Who do you have watching me, Mack|When he found the second hatchway, he went down very quickly and was just about to go to the barred cell when he saw the grimy sailor with the iron key-who must be the jailer as well, thought Amos.

"Good evening," Amos said. "How are you?"

"I'm fine, and how is yourself, and what are you doing down here?"

"I'm standing here, trying to be friendly," said Amos|They're mean and they're nasty and this one particularly," Abby returned as if she had any authority on ghosts (although she felt, at that moment, she did).

"Maybe I should get you a drink," he suggested.

"I don't want a drink," she retorted.

"Then maybe I should call Tim," he replied softly.

"You are not going to call Tim|That was all she knew. Wherever she went from here, it would be as a middle-aged woman alone.

She wished she had Nick's strength, his willingness to shove past his fear and try.

She touched the glass softly, feeling the cool smoothness beneath her fingertips. "You're going to make it, Nick|Foster had grown close to me during the confrontation, and I placed a hand against his dirty T-shirt, my gaze on the princess, on her sad face and downcast eyes. It had been Elspeth I’d seen screaming in the clouds back home. Her heart had been broken. Hearts weren’t supposed to break in Awkward. In Awkward, princesses, even awkward ones, had a prince. In Awkward, princes, even damaged ones, had a princess|I’m only sixteen years older than her so it’s not like I’m telling her how I used to walk uphill both ways to work in three feet of snow. And I’m twelve years younger than Emmy’s mother Liz, putting me between their generations.
Emmy picked up the phone on the second ring with a cheerful, “Uncle Jeff! How’s it going?”
“Great,” I lied. “You really don’t have to call me uncle|She pointed at Eli, Holly, and I.
Stephanie's icy blue eyes had hardened, and they were almost a stormy gray.
"That's enough of that," said Kae, giving Stephanie a look. "Let's discuss what we actually wanted to discuss. Are we going with Amaryllis or not?"
"I don't trust her," said Stephanie|"When I met you, I thought the name 'Abby' didn't suit you," he told her.

"Really?" she asked, leaning away from him but, he noted, trying to look like she wasn't.

This nearly made him laugh.

"Really," he replied and moved closer, "but tonight, you're an Abby|"I'm coming down," I blurted, desperate to be off the sidelines, but Bex's hand was on her ear. She was shouting at me. "You stay where you are!"

But I was already gone.

"She's lucky to have you," Zach said after a long time. "She needs you."

"What are you doing here, Zach|"Then speak and be quick about it."

His visitor arched a brow at Adarian. Shifting slightly in his chair, he caused a portion of his black button-down shirt to fall open, revealing a grisly skull tattoo in the center of his chest. His black eyes flashed with anger. "You don't order me around, Adarian|Why don’t you come inside and have a brownie or two. I baked them just for you.”
This had the desired effect. Charles put down the bucket and unlocked the door to his apartment. Ronni took the bucket from his hand and put it in the hall closet. “You just sit right down here on the couch, and I will bring you some milk to go with the brownies|He could smell them, he could even hear the heartbeat of at least two humans nearby, but that was all.

He eased himself up and through the opening. He crouched behind the crates, listening for signs of guards. After a few seconds, he was able to locate those heartbeats. They were on the other side of the crates|He listened, chuckling at her descriptions of the rides. "Your mom hasn't even been on that one?" He lifted an eyebrow in Megan's direction. "Wow. You're some pretty brave stuff, aren't you? Here's your mom again." He was still laughing when he handed the phone back to Megan|He was looking at his hands, which he'd folded into each other like the top of a tepee. "There's nothing you can do about it."

"We're here for you, Isaac," Patrick said. "Let Isaac hear it, guys." And then we all, in a monotone, said, "We're here for you, Isaac|His face appeared to be melting from under his hat. He let out a deep hiss and grabbed Ewen by the shoulders. Ewen tried to break free but the officer’s grip was too strong. He screamed out in pain as the officer leaned in to him, the stench of his breath filling Ewen’s airways. Jennifer raised her bat into the air and brought it down hard on the officer|********

Throughout the next day, I wracked my brain trying to figure out why the scent of my attacker seemed familiar. I knew I'd smelled it before, but I just couldn't identify it. It was like that elusive word stuck on the tip of your tongue. It's there, but you just can't get to it. I'd thought about her on and off all day, my attacker|Patch asked, sounding genuinely interested.

"I thought ... I flew out of the car. I literally thought ... I was going to die."

"I think that's the point."

At my sides, my arms trembled. My knees wobbled slightly under the weight of my body.

"Guess we're stuck as partners," said Patch|Will you do this and not run off?"
"Of course, Master. I'm your man."
"Maruccio, you must keep me supplied with whatever I need while I'm working. Learn to anticipate what tool I need. You can do this?"
"You got it, boss, I mean, Master|said Cain, turning to the halfback he continued, “See what you did now?  What’s wrong with you?  Can’t you count?”
“Yeah!  I just wanted to get started to get a block.”
“You don’t even block.  You only fake on that play,” said Cain|And, well . . .” he trailed off. 
Now that Holt’s kiss had worn off and I could see Samuel clearly, I felt that familiar tug I always felt when I saw him, even though his icy attitude always threw me off.
“What? Is something wrong?” I asked. Samuel had been sitting out part of the night waiting for me while I was with Holt|He tilted his head at the noise and said, "Mama?"

Eric Wu smiled down at him. He let Latisha go and knelt to the floor. Latisha tried to stop him, but the other man held her back. Wu rested his enormous hand on the boy's head. He stroked TJ's hair as he turned to Latisha|“Did he now?”
“Yes.  He has his own office and everything.”
“My, my, my.  That boy is certainly going places.”
“That he is.” Connie sighed with contentment.  “He makes a mother proud.”
“And proud you should be, Connie|Because I'm still interested, if you've reconsidered at all."

Vivienne nodded slowly, her heavy gold pendant catching the light. "I have. I'm beginning to think you might be wasted up there, with your skills."

Alice felt her hopes rise. Suddenly, the stack of contracts awaiting her back in her office didn't seem quite so endless; the dreary routine she'd been despairing, merely temporary...

"Yes, I can always accept when I've misjudged someone," Vivienne continued, her eyes fixed on Alice|“He’s deactivated half the mech wolves and put them in reserve,” Star said. “He’s sent the rest to the city outskirts to guard against scrapper gangs.”
Winston nodded and went back to staring at the carpet. Star observed him for a minute contemplating ...
Then she came to a decision.
“I’ve got just the thing for us, Winston|I'll bring you a plate when it's done,” said Jason.
"Is she making her famous garlic cheese toast to go with that lasagna?" asked Vasquez.
"Yes, I guess this means you want double?" asked Jason.
"You are such a wise young man.  Don't bother to bring Timms any, he isn't a connoisseur of fine cuisine like I am," said Vasquez|The man was too afraid to let go of the grass, but James kept shouting at him until he lunged for the tether with one hand.  He got hold of it on the second try, and with an agonised glance at James, shouted back “Can you hold my weight?”
“Yes, I can.”  By this time one of the Egron men had crept along the grass beside James, and he too got hold of the tether|We’ll be updating this bulletin as soon as we have more.”
Young switched off the television. The six of them sat in silence, not believing what they’d heard.
Ced was the first to speak. “What on earth’s happened? The place was perfectly fine when we left it.”
“I imagine we’ll find out soon enough,” said Young|I didn’t want to know what Tiny had in mind.
“What’s going on here?”  Mr. Stilton came out of his office.  He looked at all of us.  I had no way of explaining seven bikers in the shop.  Fortunately, I didn’t have to.
“We’re here to buy some stuff,” said Tiny|There was a tap on the door and Dr. Stopper walked in with Lynn behind her. "Just wanted to give you the paperwork for the baby's release, but we need a name before we can do that. Have you and MacKenzie decided on one yet?"

I untangled myself from CC and sat up. "Yes we have."

Lynn smiled at me and handed me the paperwork|My bag on my back, I rush out of the court through the dressing rooms and out to the parking lot. I find Sean’s car and get in, waiting for him to take me home. It’s not long before Sean arrives. He takes the driver’s seat and shuts the door with more force than necessary.
“I don’t know what came over me, Sean|"More primals could be in the area. We can't just leave him to die."

"Why not?" Dante shrugged. "It's what he wanted to do."

Cassie wanted to slug him.

"And what of the others?" Dante asked. "The more that you talk about so much, Cassie|It's the same one I get right before I open a can of whup-ass on Remi."

Aimee ground her teeth in frustration, but Dev was right. She knew that look intimately and had worn it a time or two herself. "Papa always breaks you guys up."

"Yeah, and if they go too far, I will too|Edward looks Jesse over so fast that he barely glances at the guy. "So, is this the new boyfriend?"

I start to cut him off, but Jesse steps next to me and takes my hand. "As a matter of fact, I am. Jesse," he says, holding out his other hand to Edward|“Probably, I guess we can head that way tomorrow.  How about we see if Tim can make us a couple of Bahama Mamas?”
“Seth.  I think you should call it a day and throw the anchor.”
I call out for Jason and Lawrence. I even try yelling for Evan but he doesn’t show up, so I start telling Jason and Lawrence how to throw the anchor|That didn't sound the sort of thing someone said when they woke up from a faint; it sounded more like the sort of thing they said because they'd heard it was the sort of thing people said. 'You fainted,' she said. She looked hard at Walter. 'Why were you in here, Walter|I, however, could not. To me they were cold and lifeless. They were pure logic, all head and no heart. But I soon noticed one of them stood out above the others. The number four showed up eight times in the sequence. Exactly half of them were fours.
I wrote out the entire strand and underlined each one of the fours|“Chief Hatcher will be relieved.”
“I’m sure,” Trent said, scowling at me.
“So, is there any news on the wall, yet?  You don’t seem to be wasting any time.”
“We try not to waste time in the land development business.  And, yes there has been some progress made on the determination about the piece of wall|"You agreed?" asked Gill.
"Absolutely," replied Alicia. "You don't get many second chances of a post in academic life." She didn't add, 'especially when you're a woman and black', but she thought it.
"You don't get many second chances of anything in life, especially happiness," said Gill|"Connor, stop," Chloe said.

"Yes," he told Keegan. "Anything."

Keegan inclined his head. "Good. You just might get the chance to prove that."

Silence.

The miles ticked past. The moon rose higher. Its power called to Connor.

"I saw you when you were a child, Connor|"But Turtle Man must be overjoyed that I can at last hear both turtle and Stone-Coat thoughts!" Ed said, grinning. "I suppose that Mouse told him already but I want to tell him about it in person myself."
The faces of Ed's visitors suddenly turned glum. "There is some really bad news, Ed|"Are you sure you want to do this?" His piercing blue eyes had just as much pain in them as I felt.

"Pour them," I responded.

He grabbed a bottle of tequila out from the freezer and filled up each of the tiny glasses. We both grabbed one and held it out in the air to toast|'But-'

They looked around. Hakardly the Lore master had spoken, and now stood with his mouth opening and shutting.

Coin turned to him, one eyebrow raised.

'You surely don't mean to close the University?' said the old wizard, his voice trembling.

'It is no longer necessary,' said Coin|I couldn't see through the murk, but I innately knew it was my pendant.

Closing my fingers around the chain, I shot up to the surface and the light from the sun hit my bloodstone. I sighed a long sigh of relief and clutched it tightly to my chest. Yelling to Gavin that I had found it, I headed back to shore|One day the Master came around and saw a group of people staring at the icon, exclaiming, ‘It is the very image of Ainênia herself, and her blessed child!’ but Calibur was unaware of them, bending in rapt concentration as he added the halo. ‘It is ready,’ said the master|Evalle jerked away from Tristan, keeping herself turned slightly away from Storm or she wouldn't be able to think. "I don't have time for a testosterone battle. And neither do you, Tristan, if we're going to find those three Alterants."

"So you're working with him now?" Storm asked.

Tristan's smile widened.

Evalle glared at Tristan to cut it out, then looked over her shoulder at Storm|I disagree and pointed out our best chance of getting her agreement was if we could offer her a suitable alternative. Perhaps if we were able to fool another vampire into vacating his or her own body Valesca might choose their instead. That however created its’ very own list of issues that we would need to overcome.
Issue one, who would be willing to trick a fellow vampire out of their body|"I am not a teenager, Eden, I do not take sides. I would just like to remind you that Noah was under orders and he disliked lying to you. He does care about you."

"You think I should forgive him?"

"Enough to let him prepare you. He is excellent at what he does, Eden|As I neared it, the smell of aged paper stung my nose. My fingers itched to open the dusty cover and touch the wrinkled pages. I leaned in close enough to make out the faded symbols stenciled across the front, though they meant nothing to me.

A shiver snaked its way through me and I thought I should probably get out of Sebastian's personal space, but something inside me just wouldn't let me move away from that book|The firefighters had the hoses going, and there seemed to be a dozen men and women at work.

"What woke you up?" The question came from the man who'd given his father the mask.

Carter answered. "Rusty." All of a sudden he realized he didn't know where his dog was. Bolting to his feet, Carter screamed, "Where's Rusty|“Captain, we were going to take the Daunte out for a little run, if you don’t mind. We will check back with you when we return.”
Joni gestured for the Captain to leave. As he walked to the bottom of the stairs, he turned and looked back up. The rottweiler continued to devour the steak as one eye stayed on the Captain|“You know,” she continued, “I always thought it was odd that whenever I thought that a migraine headache was coming on I’d go in immediately for a 4M treatment.  Yet, I’ve never had a migraine headache in my life that I can remember.  So why am I always going in for a 4M treatment|She held it up, frowning. "Pewter," she said.

"Really?" Elend asked.

She nodded. "That makes ten spikes. Two through the eyes and one through the shoulders: all steel. Six through the ribs: two steel, four bronze. Now this, a pewter one-not to mention the one he tried to use on you, which appears to be steel|In that moment, the ship rolled back into a trough on the port side of the ship, and the sailor stumbled forward, losing his balance and falling down onto the plank, desperately scrambling for a grip. One leg slipped over the edge, and his body fell over the side, just as his arms managed to wrap themselves around the edge of the plank. 
For a second he hung half suspended in mid air, one leg dangling in the air, the other still lying on the plank|"What kind of girl stuff?"

"I just needed to talk to Lily," Callie said. "I knew she'd make me feel better and she has."

Seth wasn't pleased by being blown off. He glared at both of them. Lily picked herself up off the floor and then reached down to help Callie|"That's the day of the Werewolf Fest," Abby said.

"Yes, can you make it another day?" Ivy asked, puckering her lips in the mirror.

"No," I replied gently. "It has to be that night."

"Well, we are going to the fest|“Very soon,” Orin said, “but first is there any way that I can let Hardin stay the night?”
“He isn’t from here?” Ret looked at me as if for the first time.
“No, I’ll explain tomorrow.”
Ret continued to look suspiciously at me.  “All right, I trust you, Orin|I'm sorry; I thought I could get her into the corral without waking you."

"Hannah!"

"It's all right; I know how to get her in there," Hannah said. "I just wanted to warn you she was out here, just in case."

"Thanks for the warning. How will you get her into the corral|Vance didn’t bother using the radio. Instead, he shouted, “Follow me! Head straight for the outpost and don’t stop. If you fall behind, you’ll be left there!”
Activating his microphone, he called to Ainj, “I need you covering our backs, Ainj. Once we’re out of range, take flight and meet us at the outpost|She's still that sweet baby girl I raised, but she's happy. She's better off away from all of this." She walked away but paused after a few steps. "I heard someone talking about safe houses once and how they helped people get free. They called them havens. I named her that because she was my haven|said Seldon. "The security officers will be here any minute."

"In that case," said Namarti with a feral grin, "there'll be a riot. That doesn't scare us."

"Of course it wouldn't," said Seldon. "You'd like it, but there won't be a riot|Clein said.
“Yes.”
“There’s another man in the car with us.”
“Ah, yes,” the Eternal Space Chicken of the Sacred Quack said very calmly. “I have taken him hostage. I did so at divine request.”
“Has Quack actually asked you to take him hostage|There had been himself, Gillian Dawson, the assistant librarian in charge of acquisitions, Chege Gomez, who did something unspecific in the archive section, and a new employee whose name Art had yet to discover, but who turned out to be called Lucy something and who stacked shelves and ran various errands for the deputy librarian, all nervously seated around in a circle, in the surprisingly comfortable chairs in the Librarian’s spacious office, awaiting the arrival of the Main Man.  The delay allowed plenty of time for idle speculation.
“What do you think he wants?” asked Chege, fidgeting nervously in his chair like a cat on hot bricks.
“It’s not going to be good news,” said Gillian|About half of the folks who took shelter in the town hall are here, sitting on the hard wooden benches with plates on their laps, eating pancakes and drinking juice. A kind of buffet has been set up at the back of the hall, with MRS. KINGSBURY (wearing a brilliant red hunter's cap with the bill turned around backward gangster-style) and TESS MARCHANT officiating. There's juice, coffee, and cold cereal in addition to the pancakes|Here I had myself convinced chicken just appears on the table with a nice lemon sauce on it, and you had to go and shatter my intentional delusions."

"While they're eating, let's duck into their coop and scoop out the eggs."

"I'll wait here, but thank you for asking."

Danny grinned at her. "You really want me to leave you out here by yourself with all these chickens|"And you're not one of us?" Marius asked. "You are not coming yourself?"

"I am and I am not. I chose the path of the Talamasca long ago, and that was a path to observe but never to intervene."

"I don't see that that old vow much matters now," said Marius|A rustle from the direction of Hannah Frobisher caught John’s attention and he glanced at her. Her eyes were now even wider at the mention that John might be ‘immensely’ old.
John refused to give Peterson the satisfaction of agreeing that he was right.  He shrugged wearily. “So what do you want from me, Peterson|It was a surprise for the family because it happened so quickly but I think they're settling in just fine, and so are we, right dad?" Jonathan shot his dad a look and his father was busy tapping away on his phone.

"Joshua, your son is speaking to you." Her voice was stern and his dad quickly put down the phone and looked at Jonathan|"I'll introduce you to everyone. This elderly gentleman is Bert Kosler, our custodian."

"Glad to meet you, Mr. Kosler." Handshake.

"I'm glad to meet you, too," the old man said. "This is Maggie Walsh, our theologian."

"Glad to meet you, Miss Walsh|"So," Derek asked, "are you from Chicago?"

"Sagamore," I said. "New York state."

"You're a long way from home, Sagamore."

I glanced through the windows toward St. Sophia's towers, the prickly spires visible even though we were a couple of blocks away. "Tell me about it," I said, then looked back at Derek|He left me a little something behind the painting."

Langdon shot her a startled look. "What!? But how did you know which painting? Why Madonnaof the Rocks?"

"So dark the con of man." She flashed a triumphant smile. "I missed the first two anagrams, Robert. I wasn't about to miss the third|"They're not weak, and anyone who thinks they are, is insane," Bishop said.

Glancing around at the convicts in his midst, Gill smiled. "They're all weak. Edward Myers has them all divided. A lot of the men won't want a druggie in their club. A club divided is a club weakened."

"You look like you've got a plan, Gill|Daniel and I gave up when the first rays of light came through the window. Neither of us felt any better than we had the night before.

"Are you up for any more visitors?" Erin popped her head through the door, her eyes glistening. Daniel and I welcomed her in. She hugged me, and then wrapped her arms around Daniel|I saw far below their miserable procession in the half-light, the long winding line of them progressing down the mountain under the purple sky and the rising evening star. The weak helped the strong; the old carried the young.

"Where will they go, back to that evil town? Back to the monsters who gave them up in sacrifice|“He had an accident on the rug.” Sabrina glanced towards a dark stain near Ben’s chair.
“And you tried to clean it with air deodorizer?” Mitzy pressed the dog closer to her chest and let out a slow breath. She could keep calm, if she tried.
“It said disinfecting…” Sabrina chewed her bottom lip and looked up at Mitzy|His grin widened. "I was fairly certain someone would try to follow us. I have been giving it quite a bit of thought as we walked, working out a plan."

Ivory's amber gaze narrowed as it drifted over his face. He looked younger. Happier. She had done that but ...

"Trust me, Ivory|He leaned forward again. “You, too, can become a fine pianist.  I am sure of it.”  He waggled a finger at her. “Choose to keep playing, Carol.  Do not stop.”  He closed his eyes for a few moments.  Opening them again, he said:  “When I am well, I will give you lessons|"I told you we were supposed to move the cattle," his brother Ned chimed in.

Jake stifled an urge to bang his head against the wall. Ned's voice often acted like nails across a chalkboard in his mind. This was one of those times. And it was a reminder that while someday Jake would inherit the Double-Bar-K and finally get to take charge of how it was run, he would still have to contend with his brothers-including Ned|You might lose a toe."

"Carmine, I was born prematurely in the horse stables, and I survived. I've had the daylights beaten out of me, and I survived. I've had a gun shoved against my throat, and I survived. It's frozen water ... I'll survive|Many of them have patterns drawn on them like on Eduard’s arm, some have triangles, and some have squares, and they’re in different spots, Becca realizes as she looks around the circle. The moment conflicts her on the inside. For so long, she’s been told to never take off the mask, no matter what. No matter the scoff. Never take it off. But in this moment… this is the moment she chooses. And she can choose to either be a part of the society, or a part of something completely opposite, something completely whimsical, almost magical, it seems…
She turns back to look at Eduard|Coming to a halt directly before Darcy, the woman slowly smiled and any unease at her less than human status was forgotten.

There was an entire world of kindness in that smile.

"Am I disturbing you?" she asked gently.

"Not at all." Darcy tilted her head to one side. "Are you a friend of Styx?"

"Not precisely. I'm Shay, and you must be Darcy|"What a bucket of kittens that will be," I said.

Sofia began to nod before she realized I was being sarcastic.

Then, all earnest, she said, "Mom said she might go out with us."

Her face shone.

I couldn't take the hope in her expression. "Oh, please! They aren't getting back together, Sofia|As it stands, we don't have enough to hold him. Especially now that Sims has flown the coop."

"What are you talking about?"

"Sims. I had deputies looking for him yesterday, last night, and this morning. After he left here, he just vanished. No one's been able to find him, and Harvey isn't willing to let any of this go on unless he can talk to Sims|While he ate, Peake watched the monitors and gazed through the window at the bungalow. At 4:20, she announced, “I see our white pick up, it’s just entered the street.”
Lang dropped his sandwich and picked up a pair of binoculars. He saw the truck pass between houses before it disappeared in front of the bungalow|They could have gotten through to Melody if they'd known that the section of the lines that Joel had drawn wasn't Rithmatic-but, just like before, chalklings seemed as fooled by a fake line as a human might be, at least at first.

Joel burst through the hole in the end of the small maze. "Close it!"

Melody did so, blocking the chalklings. The things immediately turned around to escape back out the front of the maze|He studied her like he'd studied the Eris. Like Renna was just another thing to be used.

She forced her body to stay relaxed. She'd be damned if she let him see how uncomfortable he made her.

Finally, he smiled slightly, baring his teeth. "I'm glad to see I wasn't mistaken about you back on Lenue, Renna|“I think it may be time to open that picnic basket of yours Cora.”
Cora smiled weakly and took his hand, “There’s a small wood burning stove inside we should gather some firewood. It’s going to get cold when the sun goes down, and I only have one blanket.”
“I’d rather not start a fire, Cora|The pliant branches fell back into place behind them, hiding them from the outside world like a glowing green curtain.

Jake circled behind her, as though allowing her a moment to marvel at the beauty of where he had brought her. Suddenly, he jerked her arm back, putting her off-balance. At the same time he knocked his knee into the back of hers|We made our way around the various different foods being offered that day. As hungry as I was, everything sounded and smelled remarkably good. I finally decided on a nice, juicy, greasy, burger and fries and called out my order to the cafeteria lady. I stepped back, giving Kane room to make his order|There were six porcelain gnomes just sitting there in the dirt, as if someone had placed them there. I looked around for the culprit.
But there was nobody there.
I began walking again, but this time the two donkey’s treading in front of me, glancing back nervously. But every time I time I turned around, there was no one there, but the gnomes|When she had moved out the first time - the only time - Mark had reacted badly. It started with bed-wetting. When she and Linda reunited, the bedwetting stopped. Until now.

"He knows what's going on," Linda said. "He can feel the tension."

"What do you want me to do about that, Linda|Jesse caught the witch’s eye. Ember was pushing herself up off the ground, and her rage seemed to hiccup when their gazes met. The witch gasped and drew back a step. For a moment, she looked almost afraid.
“Impossible,” she whispered.
Jesse grabbed the gun from Ashton and pulled at his elbow to stand, then pointed the gun at the witch|Ana was lying on the bottom of the canoe, crying and taking heavy breaths. 
	“You just relax Ana. I’ll get us back to shore.”
	Dizzy rowed slowly back to shore. When they were close enough, Dizzy climbed out of the boat and stood up in the water. He leaned into the canoe and bent down to pick up Ana|Anyway, I'm headed south in the morning, after I get some more cantaloupes, bananas, and other fruit and vegies, and put them out tonight for Issy and her friends."
"Turtle friends?"
"Turtles, and lots of other animals too. Apparently, when the turtles talk, other animals listen, and the turtles have come to a consensus to all head south. Issy says the first wave will hit town tonight, led by turtles|"There's only the cave and that would be useless in the long term. At least we have facilities here."
*
"We can go out the way I came in," Erika suggested when everyone met in the cabin's living room half an hour later. 
"Yes, how did you get in here, Erika|She wouldn't have too many more moments like this, she suspected, so she had to enjoy them while she could.

"Your brother," she said with a shake of her head.

"The curse," Riley whispered in her ear.

"What?"

"Remember? When one of my brothers is attracted to a girl, she will only see him as ugly|Brad spent the rest of the evening at the bar with Jane just talking and getting to know each other. Mind you Brad was still very guarded on his identity, but they hit it off well. In fact when it was time to leave Jane went with him to the Motel, where the conversation carried on. Jane was trying her hardest to get into bed with Brad|“But if you have...” He finished the thought by giving Toler a sly smile.
Blatcher was more wheeze than laugh now, his guffaws rough and wet-sounding. He cleared his throat, spat something colorful on the floor, and lit up a cigarette. “Alright, on to the important stuff. How do we deal with Calistari?”
“We save his life,” said Toler|He won the writing competition and he has his last game this afternoon. I haven't even properly congratulated him. I round the corner and stop the moment I spot a crowd of people near my locker.

An underclassman nods her head in my direction. "She's here."

The whispering and laughing cease and people distance themselves from me and my locker|Suddenly a few notes of eerie classical music boomed through the house, so loud that Olivia and Ivy both put their hands to their ears.

Somebody turned down the volume abruptly, and then smoke started pouring out of the cellar. "Dry ice," Olivia's father said proudly.

A pale hand emerged, quivering, from the cellar|“I have a question,” Becca chimes in. 
Victoria stops where she lands from springing around inside the little group, and turns to look at her. All eyes flicker to Becca and she starts to feel uncomfortable. 
“Yes?” Victoria asks. 
“What do you need this—face for? I don’t understand what’s going on…” 
Eduard and Victoria look at each other and then turn back to Becca|"Would it be wrong to wear pajamas to a guard meeting?"

"It would be inappropriate," Ethan said. "But I think you're more than excused from leathers or a suit tonight."

"Sweatpants?"

"You're dating the Master of the House."

I took that as a "no" on the sweatpants|Viktor was mine, as you apparently know. But I have your three friends. I was there when you called on the phone. They're in the house, sealed away, about to be consumed by Greek fire. Just thought you'd like to know."

Still silence.

"Keep an eye out," she whispered to Viktor|When Pridmore came down at last she said, "Fie for shame, what a sulky face."

And Matilda said, "I'm not."

"Oh, yes, you are," said Pridmore-"you know you are-you don't appreciate your blessings."

"I wish it was your Aunt Willoughby," said Matilda|To the west, a large white dome protrudes from the ice, the remnants of the once lush island of Lanai. To my north, a snow covered mountain extends over the eastern portion of Molokai. I picture the northern facing cliffs, currently out of my view that were once home to cascading waterfalls flowing into the ocean. Frozen cliffs must now take the place of the beautiful waterfalls|Things you can’t just run away from.”
“Spare me the lecture,” Bryn said as she rolled her eyes.
“Everything all right, dear?” came a nasally voice from the yard next door.  Her neighbor was standing at the foot of her driveway.  She glared at Dane suspiciously.
“Yes, Mrs. Crocker,” said Bryn|John was reluctant to answer.  “Hunter, this isn’t easy.  José was at the center of the Jenson investigation.  He basically introduced the Senator to Peña after determining that Jenson was of low moral character, shall we say.”
Hunter hesitated.  “Was José corrupt?”
John waited a moment then looked directly at Hunter|'What time is it?' She sounds defeated.

'Time you were in bed,' I say, and lift her into my arms. Her hands go around my neck.

'You're getting long, Bloom.'

'Too long for you, Barrington.'

'Never too long for me, Bloom|My gaze locked onto the artifact case that Alexei had been looking at earlier-the one with two swords in it.

A Reaper broke away from the circle around Oliver and Alexei and rushed toward me. I waited until the figure was in range, then spun around him and ran toward the artifact case.

I skidded to a halt in front of the case|Turning to face Violet and the Kick execs, I lean against the edge of the table and pick out a few notes as I tune my guitar.

I sing "Every Time I Close My Eyes" first, a song I wrote three years ago. I believed in it then, but now? Now I love it even more. It takes on a whole new meaning since I met Violet|Geramn pulls his pack from his back and reaches into it, extracting a water skin. He pops open the top and squirts a stream of water into his mouth. His stomach grumbles, reminding him it has been several hours since his last meal. He grabs several strips of deer jerky from his pack and then closes it. Dropping the pack against the wall, he sits and leans back upon it, taking a bite of the jerky|"Maybe we did. Doesn't make it easier, though."

"Probably not."

Silence reigned a moment or two. Jason straightened up and Cab could tell he was shouldering his new reality. He wasn't the type to cry over spilt milk. He wasn't the type to cry, period|I exhaled slowly and tried to suppress a shiver.

"You have a week," he said, turning away and disappearing into the hatch. "Bring her," he called to Ivan.

"Mal-" I began as Ivan grasped my arm.

Mal lifted his bound hands, reaching for me. His fingers grazed mine briefly, then Ivan was hauling me back toward the hatch|He permitted me to twiddle with the radio knobs as we drove up and down Abbott Kinney looking for something that was open late and wasn't a bar. A bar would be fine, except I'd be recognized, and seeing people drinking would remind me of how glorious and friendly I got when I drank, and it would all be over.

No, in retrospect, a bar would not be fine|"Only for the next twenty four hours." She turned back to Cyrus. "Shall we begin?"

"Already?" Eden squeaked. She started to lose control of her heart rate. She hadn't realised this would be happening so soon.

Cyrus nodded and she felt Val squeeze her hand. "We should get it over with, Eden|I never understood why you wanted to be an attorney anyway. I think a better match might be pharmacy school. You were always good at science. I have an in at the school at U Dub. You may still be able to swing it for the fall."

"In what parallel universe would my dropping out of law school mean I wanted to be a pharmacist|They want us crazy and lost first."

"Well, they're doing a really good job of it," I grumbled.

"Hey," he tilted my chin up and stared into my eyes- all the way in, all the way into my soul. "You're not crazy and you're not lost|She tried to speak a few times but was promptly ignored, so she went to the big dining-room, made a call and, after spreading the things she had brought over the enormous table, she began to work.

Exactly an hour later, the doorbell rang. Beth answered it, already knowing who it was.
“Hi Bern, I’m glad you could come!” Beth greeted, hugging him.
“I’m always here for you, Beth|Abby had taken a few sips of coffee and had come to no conclusions why Cash would want her there early when Cash walked in.

His eyes never leaving her, he went straight to his desk, tossed a file and his pen on it and both skidded several inches across the mess before coming to a stop.

Abby watched this and her gaze went back to Cash|He had lived in Alice Springs for at least three years, but he appeared to have no friends, no one had even properly spoken to him except the mail collector three years ago. Yet he had to be a real person, he definitely had a real body; that is, of course, if the body was really his. The Toyota was linked to the billabong, and the Toyota was linked to him. But there was nothing to link him to the billabong, or anywhere else, except the Toyota|"Put your arms around my neck, Tempest," he ordered softly, his voice a blend of huskiness and hypnotic power.

Rusti reluctantly complied, and he lifted her up, forcing her to look into his black, burning eyes. She almost groaned. She could get lost in his eyes. No one should have those eyes.

"I want you to hear me this time, Tempest|When he'd been close to her in that alley, when her body had been pressed against his, the scent of sweet honey had teased his nose. So maybe he wanted to catch that scent again.

Or maybe he just wanted to be closer to her.

"Ditch any lovers lately?" Saxon asked her because a woman like her, she'd have plenty of lovers|"

"Nothing, if ye don't mind riding in a sea of silk, " Henry muttered in disgust. "It's too damnsmall forthe three of us, let alone all four."

"Well, he can just follow inhiscarriage, " she argued, but not with verymuch force behind it. A momentlater, as Henry pursed his lips and looked downhis nose at her, she heavedasigh and started out of the carriage|Ellen loves to knit and she's already taught three of her friends. Her teacher was so impressed she thought it might be a good idea for the whole class to learn."

Evelyn nodded approvingly. "Ellen's teacher mentioned that to me. She said knitting will help the children with math concepts and learning patience. It'll also give them a sense of achievement|But Amelia had found out about "Killz".  That was some spray on stuff that covered up color and pencil marks and blended into the paint.
"What do you want?" Belle called.
"Umm, nothing.  We don't want anything."
The boys walked into the kitchen and stood staring at Belle|She grabbed Dante's arms and started dragging him back toward that elevator. They'd get down to the lower floor, then he could heal. All she had to do was buy him some time. Just a little time.

When he rose, would he even remember her?

Coughing, choking on that smoke, she made it to the elevator|She guided Clara out to the street where the crowd had swelled and mounted police pranced their horses menacingly around the edges.
‘Clara! Clara!’ It was Mary pushing through the throng, one hand holding a placard above her head.
At the sight of Mary Clara burst into tears. ‘What am I going to do, Mary|I would have felt pretty lame, except Bex was totally thrown too.

"Hey there, Lizzie," Bex said with what little breath she could draw. "Have a nice holiday?"

But I doubt Liz even heard.

"Why didn't you two call me? Why didn't you e-mail or write or ..." She pulled back, then looked from me to Bex|Tanner’s muffled shouting seemed to hurt his ears, as he covered them, backing away momentarily, dropping a length of garden hose which hit the floor with a strange heavy thud. Tanner saw that it was taped off on both ends. Tanner stared at it in disbelief. Jay recovered his composure almost immediately, and a new calm seemed to pass over him. 
“Why did you have to go there, Tanner|Using her kinetics to swirl dirt like a small tornado, she whipped it up until dust flew into his eyes.

While the old guy lashed out blindly, Evalle dragged Kell out of the fog zone. Once he had taken a few breaths, she shook him. "Are you with me now, Kell|"Vikus, I cannot -" stammered Hamnet.

"You can! Only think about it. Think of the child. If something should happen to you." Vikus pulled back, almost shaking Hamnet by his shoulders. "What do you do here that you could not do there?"

"I do no harm," said Hamnet|She opened the patio door and let herself back into the front room, where she'd left her brightly patterned satchel. "So don't feel like you missed out on anything, because you really didn't. It's been a while and I'm pretty rusty in that area. So seriously, this is probably for the best." She said all of this loudly, so he could hear her from the patio|“A Memorex?” Mark studied the golden orb sitting in the palm of his hand. 
A whisper of noise floated down the stairway. Mark and Jason tensed, listening intently for any other sounds that someone was there but all they heard was Tyler mumbling about birds and cages. After a moment Jason looked at Tyler’s vacant expression then back at Mark|"Some soup, my lord," said the woman beside me. "Only a little for you have been starving."

I drank.

"No more. You sleep."

And beneath the tent I did.

The desert cooled, but I never lacked for robes or blankets. Soup again, take this, and then sleep|"You know I can see you perfectly, right?"

I guess I was more obvious than I thought.

"Good night, Levi." I rolled over.

"I'm not ready to say goodnight." He moved behind me, his arms wrapped around my waist.

"You were ready to fall asleep earlier|“We had a lot of fun, didn’t we?”
Anna stood on the bottom of the step and handed me the top to a pair of long underwear. “This will have to do. I’ve seen some reenactors wearing long underwear tops.”
I took the shirt and said, “You surprise me a little, Anna|"We'll figure something out. So you're more comfortable."

"Why are you here?" asked Tori, hoping her sister would hurry up and leave.

"I brought you something."

Andra moved her hand and the flare of fire stabbed Tori's eyes. She hissed in pain, falling to a crouch to cover her head so she wouldn't get burned|But I digresseth, for it was the manner of Corgley’s death which did draw suche greate attention from ye populace, for he was walking as normale down the center streete, when suddenly a gashe of large proportiones did appear upon his neck and arms, and he did vanish in a fountain of bloode, from which his bodie could not be founde. The terrible power of ye Daemon of Gorey’s Hollow has become apparent, and it seems as if his power doth extend beyond the Hollow itselfe.

Reinhouer flipped ahead three more pages, to the next entry:

Three more have met their endes at my request at the handes of ye Daemon of Gorey’s Hollow|His confident smirk sent her over the edge and Rachel struggled against him, ready to do damage to any part of his body that she could get her hands on.

Ian leaned down and closed his mouth over hers, knocking her breath out from shock as his tongue slid along her lips. Before she could bite him, he pulled back.

"I won't leave without you, Rachel|Dimitri and my mother were going in here, and as I gave them one last glance, my feelings had little to do with my earlier romantic interlude. Everything I felt was worry, worry I'd never see them again. I had to remind myself that they were tough - two of the best guardians out there. If anyone would come out of this, it was them|Julian looked up. "You saw one?"

"They live in the woods. Warden left me with one of them."

"Does that mean you passed your tests?" Suspicion crossed his face. "You're a red-jacket?"

"I don't know. I thought I was, but"-I tugged my tunic-"this doesn't look red|His face darkened with anger and his fingers dug into her hip. "Is Logan still here? I'd like to have ... words with him."

"You should be more worried about what your lady is going to do and less about what Logan is doing."

"The Sanguinar are up to something," said Logan|She pointed at my charm bracelets.
I moved my wrists, and the multi-colored vintage beads and stars hanging from the gold chain jingled. “From a gypsy trader I know.”
“Seriously?”
“Uh-huh. A cousin of my grandmother’s.”
Kylie’s eyes rounded. “So you’re, like, a real gypsy|Perhaps I shall come with you."

"You would not like it, up in the sky," the star assured him. "So ... I take it you will not be marrying Victoria Forester."Tristran nodded. "No," he said.

"I met her," said the star|"A little angel told me you might need this," he said, unfolding it for Luce, who took it gratefully.

"Who you calling little?" Arriane popped up from behind a tree, followed by Gabbe, who brought forward the Watchers book.

"We came to say ban voyage," Gabbe said, handing the book to Luce|"This place smells kind of like something decaying," I said.

"Nonsense. Come along!" Gideon closed the door behind us, took the torch from me again, and went down the dark corridor. I followed him.

"Aren't you going to blindfold me again?" I asked, only half joking.

"It's dark, you'd never remember the way," replied Gideon|"Have I come at a bad time, Master Alec?"
"No worse than normal, Donovan, I'm just not handling things as well today. Please come in."
Donovan gave me a respectful nod and then waited as I turned on the three privacy generators stationed about my room.
"What can I do for you, Donovan|I asked glad that Claire got to see Jasper, but concerned over David.
She smiled slightly.  “They are wise, but to get them to help sometimes is hard.  They are part creatures of the sea and have a cold, inhuman edge to their personality, especially as they grow older.  If anyone can help David, it’s them|The jeeps drove back to the helicopters. The fifty thousand dreams were carried carefully, jar by jar, on to the helicopters. The soldiers climbed back on board, but the BFG and Sophie stayed on the ground. Then they all returned to where the nine giants were lying.

It was a fine sight to see them, these great air machines hovering over the trussed-up giants|He was watching the Sun's light brightening the clouds along the horizon at the end of the ravine.
Petr walked up behind him, ‘Mind if I join you?’
Matt turned his head a quarter turn and shrugged his shoulders.
‘That was pretty scary,’ Petr nodded back in the direction of the camp.
Matt said nothing.
‘They terrified me the first time I saw them on that lonely hill with Jenna,’ said Petr|Even if you think those codes are clear, we're purging them." Her heart was beating faster. It could be a setup. She'd sure seen setups before. Poor Cale. Evidence had been planted left and right to frame him. She knew better than to jump hungrily at the first bone that was tossed her way.

But maybe their hacker didn't know about the case with Cale|"Let us go within, where we may speak," Bowen said.

Graeme started to gesture toward Teague to accompany him and Bowen inside when Bowen put out his hand to stop his brother.

"Nay," Bowen said quietly. "What I have to say needs be said in private."

Teague's eyebrows rose and Graeme's eyes narrowed as he studied Bowen|“But, yes, we did first meet to discuss her son. I was involved then in the anti-war movement. Loraine wanted advice on how her son could avoid the draft. I gave her several suggestions and referrals to medical professionals who would assist in securing a deferment.”
“Did she and her son pursue any of your suggestions|Ana didn’t really know how to answer the question. She was supposed to give a positive response according to customs, but it wouldn’t be the truth. Now that Vo was standing in front of her, she realized just how much she had wanted him and missed him all this time. 
“I can’t complain,” said Ana|Before you think I'm the worst, I was thrilled when she made a quick recovery. The doctor said she was practically at a hundred percent and green-lit her discharge from the hospital. I couldn't have been happier--for both human decency and selfish reasons. Selfishly because it meant Jacob could spend more time at home instead of the hospital|I was supposed to drop by tonight and give Bill some information. Is he available?"

The female vampire laughed at me, which was nothing I wasn't used to. My smile notched up a degree brighter. This critter radiated danger the way a light bulb gives off heat.

"This little human gal here says she has some information for you, Bill|When the desert plates were carried away, Max leaned back in his chair and watched her. "How about if we get to the point of your request for lunch? I have to admit that I'm curious. It isn't every day I get invited to lunch by a beautiful woman."

Clarissa blushed and lowered her eyes to her plate. "I'm sure it happens often enough that it isn't a surprise, Max|“Yes, I am absolutely sure you did, Cook.  I can see the empty egg boxes like you said, thirteen of them.”
Captain Porter was used to getting to the bottom of these sorts of incidents, especially when it involved some of his boys.
“Has anyone else been in the kitchen, Cook|Lying at the bottom of the box was a stack of bonds with my name on them. I took a deep breath and composed myself before closing the lid on the box and leaving the room.

My phone chimed. I reached in my pocket and pulled it out; there was another text from Connor.

"Where are you Ellery?"

I looked at his words, my heart aching and I didn't want him to worry, so I replied|He only holds tighter, arms wrapped around me, nearly cutting off my air supply. “Now, Willow, I thought we already established I’m not going to hurt you.”
I wiggle against him, trying to hike my knee up, but our bodies are flush against each other.
His eyes capture mine, turning dark. “It’s time to calm down, Willow|The cold from the sheets seemed seep inside him from across the room when silence met him, but he tried not to let that bother him. Summer had always been an early riser. Striding to the back door, he opened it and went outside. Warm relief flooded him when he spotted her at the end of the pier, wrapped in a quilt.

Warm relief turned to hot desire when she dropped the quilt|After the grocery store, she ran into a hardware store and purchased a cheap generator, a gas can, and a lamp. The men at the store helped her wheel the generator out to the truck and hefted it inside. When the men were done making sure she had someone to help her get it out, she went to the gas station to fill her tank and gas can. 
She drove home, happy she had made the decision to buy the generator|“Oh, hey, Squirrel of Vengeance,” said Duke.  He walked over, plucked the rifle from Buck Marion’s gnarled fists, and broke it in half, tossing the pieces away.  Then he pushed over the Exsanguinator with two fingers and climbed on his chest, ready to punch the mercenary into pudding.
“You got one chance,” said Duke|Colton’s throat was dry as a desert. He looked away from Adsen and wanted to be anywhere else in the world but in that room.
“But now I will atone,” said Adsen. “I will go forward with my work, this time so others can be saved. You will stop me before I finish, won’t you, Colton|Now," he said, nodding, "that's a good story. There once was a cottage with three little bears-"

Ash clamped his hand over His Grace's mouth.

Sofia gasped at the rudeness. Had they any decency? The man was a duke! One simply did not put his hands on a duke|You come with me and we’ll have some fun.  As good as YOU are, you don’t need to practice every day.”

“Where’s Tony?” asked Coach Andrews when he brought the team together at the mound.
“Maybe he’s sick,” someone said on his behalf.
“I saw him this afternoon and he didn’t look sick,” said the coach|"Tell them I'm in a meeting." Tanner turned to Pauline. "We have to get out of here." He patted Andrew on the shoulder. "Andrew, come with us." "Yes, Tanner." The three of them walked over to the redbrick building. "I have something very important for you to do, Andrew|“I don’t know how to do your spell. I don’t even have my mother’s book anymore, thanks to you. Maybe you can find another witch to help you.”
I’m about to slam the door when he says, “Wait.”
“Now what?”
“I’ll give you your mother’s book back if that’s what you need for the spell|“is that a yes yes, or a Nicky yes?”
“it's a no.”
“ok. good. so the plan…?”
“before all that, we need to go to the florist.”
i took a few hits of wine. “we have to go to the florist|Chuch went on, "And you promised to look after Cami, if somebody ever comes gunning for me."

"That's not gonna happen," I whispered.

Even if it did, he had a huge extended family. I suspected he and Eva had chosen Chance and me for the honor of godparents just to prevent infighting between their massive respective clans. But if the worst came to pass, yeah, I'd take Cami|That would shut us down.' Salzella sighed. 'Look, it weighs more than a ton,' he said. 'The supporting rope is thicker than your arm. The winch is padlocked when it's not in use. It's safe.' They looked at one another. 'I'll have a man guard it every minute there's a performance,' said Salzella|I always like protecting the observant ones.  They keep me on my toes.  What’s she like?”
“Smart and beautiful.  Now, let me get back to my duties.  I’ll talk to you after school.”
“All right,” said Beckwyn.  “James is coming over to talk to me now anyway|You don’t have to stop if you love it this much.”
George shook his head. “No one on the other end. No one who can see the one exotic hair comb among hundreds that will cause an English girl’s heart to skip a beat. No one that I could find anyway.”
Sebastian said softly, “I’m sorry, George|“Just that he had seemed so great and she still really liked him, but she thought that he might be dating someone else too,” Suzie said. “Liz was really upset about it and not sure what to do. She really liked him.”
“Did she say who she thought he was dating|No different to any of the others, except it's jammed tight into place. I give it a harder shake, to make sure it isn't simply stuck. No movement at all.

I try pulling the bottle out - it doesn't give.

Studying it again, frowning. My eyes focus on the cork. I grin. Put the tip of my right index finger to the face of the cork|The only reason that I can tell that he's upset is the way his fingers twitch every few seconds, as if he's.

Dean gazes past Peter, and gives me a look that makes me sick inside. "Or did you already do her?"

Peter doesn't answer.

Sam is annoyed, "Cut it out, Dean|It was not the stage on which the opera she'd watched two nights ago had been performed; there were no box seats nor velvet-covered chairs arranged in rows in a half circle around it. The decor was not gilt and marble, but raw, rough wood and cracked plaster. A small square window studded one wall, near the ceiling just above her head, which, Victoria noticed, was made of open beams and covered with cobwebs|"What are you doing downstairs?"

Max folded his arms over his chest. "I felt your pain and was wondering what caused it."

His concern touched her deeply. It was true, watching the family around her made her ache for the one thing she wanted most.

Fang Kattalakis. A wolf who'd been half dead, he'd been brought here by his brother, and Aimee had nursed him back to health the same way she had Max|Shelly was honest enough to admit that regardless of how much she might have been drawn to the baby, the chances of her becoming the doting grandmother were very slim anyway.  Shelly was just beginning to enjoy life.  She wasn't going back to being a frumpy homemaker.  And she really didn't care to be seen as a grandmother|"Is that what you think I've got for you? A stupid little crush?" Peter asked.

Laura shook her head and stared at the pavement. "I don't know what you're thinking or feeling about me. I love him."

"He's using you. You're a young and beautiful woman, Laura|He's a good guy. You know I wouldn't defend someone that I didn't truly believe that about."

I rolled my eyes.

"He's being terrible to Rule and Shaw, and I'm not going to just watch."

"That's a family matter. Rule can fight his own battles, and he isn't going to let anything happen to Shaw|"How do I get to Iona from here?" asked Fergus. 
"Oh it's simple. You sail to the main channel, and come to Veridis Insula. Turn left and go down the channel until you come to a large island on your right hand. That's Mull. Follow the coast line of Mull until it turns north and there is Iona|But she still flirted with the idea that when used as a social lubricant alcohol had its benefits, and that perhaps, at times, one drink wouldn’t necessarily hurt.
Though in truth, many times her own life experiences had proven her wrong.
By her mid-twenties, she was already traveling down the path of a drunkard. In fact, before her mother died, one of their last conversations was about the drinking|After today, when the bus delivered Carter to his home, it was unlikely he'd ever see Rusty again. Carter couldn't bear to have that happen, but he had to prepare himself for disappointment.

Because it was the last day before winter break, school was dismissed an hour early. While Carter lined up with his friends for bus number seven, he scanned the area for Rusty|She was really going to campaign to get Preston to wear that outfit every day just so she could see me again. If she hadn't already edged her way into my heart, she'd have done so then.

"Actually, Daisy, I think he looks nice all the time. He just caught me looking this time."

Daisy's eyes went big, and a grin broke out on her face when she looked back at Preston|As the car careened off the road and rolled again and again, I had only one thought: I never got to tell Sam I loved him.

Pain is a funny thing. You know that you hurt. You know that your body isn't working the way it should, but you can't really feel it, you know? The pain is sometimes so intense that you're numb|“Perhaps it’s just me,” said Simmons, “but I would feel a lot more comfortable if Welles handled the preliminary.”
“Oh, I don’t know,” said Callahan. Then, remembering what had been said about career and future and full support, added, “I’ll see what I can do.”
“That would be much appreciated,” said Simmons|“Hmmm, thank you,” Bob said, unsure if he could really eat something that looked like the pufferfish–fugu translated from Japanese to English as river pig– and eat it raw, yet.
“I have to go bathroom,” Sabrina said, popping one of her sushi slices in her mouth and getting up.  While she was gone Bob looked carefully at the pufferfish sushi|“Have you violated it?”
“No.” It came out as a growl. And she didn’t really blame him.
“Then how do you—”
“Training. Do you want my services or not, rich girl?”
“Stop calling me that. My name is Rachel, and I’m not rich|"What are you doing?" he asked, holding her tight as the rapture from her touch consumed him.

"Playing."

Isaac growled as she worked him. The inexperience of her touch made him lose control. He shouldn't be responding to her touch so easily.

"Teach me what you like, Isaac|My dry eyes blinked. She stared back. She was not giving up on this. "My body used to be one thing and now it's another," I admitted. "I don't know if this body even knows how to be out in public, dancing. And if I can't, I might not be able to handle the disappointment|She looked much better than she had when last he'd seen her, better even than she had in more than a month. She actually looked healthy, her cheeks filled out and rosy, her face peaceful. A small sigh of relief slid from Paul's mouth and then he glanced to Eshe.

"Where is Jeanie?"

"Upstairs," Eshe said, standing. "Nicholas and I have to go up too|He laughed.
	Serena laughed, too, “Oh, well…make sure you don’t do a pit stop to Singapore or something…”
	“I won’t,” He said, “And…don’t worry, we’ll find each other.” He went on, “I love you, Serena|She suspected some stops he was adding for her benefit rather than his, but each time they sat on the cold, damp ground she sighed with relief. The trip to Dr. Carton's lab should only have taken a few hours.  Instead it lasted for the rest of the day.  The dull pearl of the sun sank behind its clouds as they reached the lab|He got the bandanna he used to clean his reading glasses from his sock drawer and attempted to tie it over her eyes. But she didn't want him to use it. She kept shaking her head, which made it difficult to get the darn thing on.

"Why do we have to add a blindfold|he asked, feeling both guilty and foolish. "Why did you call me Tom?"
Dr. Redhead chuckled softly, but the sound was not unkind. "I know a great many things now," he answered, "things I did not know before. There is no more need for pretence between us, Tom|When she was first invited, she did not know the marquis or much about him, and she wanted someone to come with her, so I offered. And I have been every time since.”
“So she is still uncomfortable in her visits to the marquis?”
“Perhaps.”
What kind of answer was that? “What do you know of the marquis|He stood. "Let me cal Roger right now.

When does Emma leave on tour?"

"Friday morning. She'l spend Friday night, al day Saturday, and Saturday night in Chicago. When she leaves there, I'l have neutralized the threat. I'l come home, and she can continue on to Denver for the rest of her tour|Experience from the past year told him that the silence could reach past dropping her off.

The thought of losing her again panicked him almost as much as the idea of marriage.

How far would he go to keep her?

* * *

Could she be pregnant? Lori drummed her fingers against the box of crayons on the kitchen table. She was late enough for it to be a possibility|“It was his birthday,” she simply stated, in an attempt to defend the both of them. 
“Oh, so what you're saying is that it's okay to disobey your authorities on your birthday?”
Danika kept her eyes on the floor, trying to shield herself from the accusatory words spoken by her uncle.
“I want you to look at me, Danika|“Open the door and step inside the garage.  But stay where I can see you.”
Nicholas opened the door, reached inside, and snapped on the light.  He then looked back at Eddie with a “What now?” expression.
“We’ll take my car,” Eddie said.
Nicholas looked at the Honda then looked back at Eddie|"Gruber, it's good to talk to you. When I am overcome with the duties of the day, it is pleasant to take a few moments to listen to your philosophy of life."

"Ah, First Minister, it is no philosopher I am. My schooling was very sketchy."

"You don't need schooling to be a philosopher|Jaysh jerked his head at the old man, found him gawking and pointing to the west (one long, aged finger trying to poke invisible holes in the mist) and spun himself around. 
Ahead of him, instead of three burrows drifting from the hovering white, there came a colony of lumpy, brown shapes. Only colony wasn’t the right word. What Jaysh saw swimming towards him from the risers was much too spacious to be a colony|"Not if I drain them to the point where their hunger overshadows their loyalty toward you."

Fury engulfed Niccolo's mind. He stepped toward the fence, reaching for Andrus.

"Uh-oh," Andrus snorted. "You're angry and aren't thinking straight. Remember, you can still save them all if you bring me Reyna."

"Do I look like a fool, Andrus|Jake was dimly aware that they'd left the barn, but he was too busy trying to calm Chester to pay them much attention. "There, boy. Come on, settle down. That's a good boy." He kept up a stream of easy words and motioned for Holt to step back. His father did so, leaving him alone with the horse|‘There is one thing in common with all of us; we are made up of the elements of the earth itself.

But considering he had taken off to be alone with Kendall, he felt guilty despite the fact that he'd believed Hannah was settled and cared for. And he was sure Kendall wouldn't be any more pleased than he was.

Before dealing with their feelings though, they had to pick up Hannah|The emails he sent were always the same:

I just want to know that you're doing okay.

J.

Her answers were always two words:

I'm fine.

H.

In January when he emailed, she was fine.

For the rest of the winter when he wrote, she was fine.

In the spring, she answered his query the same way: she was fine|It looked lovely and inviting. When Jody asked if I had a suit, I assured her I had one under my clothes and thanked her for helping me. She returned to the main party, and I slipped into a bathroom where I shape-shifted into a turquoise bikini.

Some people eyed me curiously, probably wondering who I was, but they left me alone once I was in the pool|A muscle flexed in Gunner's hard jaw. "You thought I wanted you."

This was the hard part. The part that would tear her pride to shreds, but what did pride matter now? "No, but I knew I wanted you." That was her secret shame. She'd been with Slade; she'd met him first...

Then she'd met Gunner|"Jack." I smiled, my eyes meeting Melissa's. "That's incredible! Congratulations."

"Thank you. But, Cassie?" He paused. "I'm really sorry. I should have listened to you. I never should have married her."

"You didn't know she was lying, Jack|The taxi took him into a pleasant neighbourhood and stopped in front of a manicured lawn. 
“Yes, I've been here,” the driver said, taking the money from Tim.
“You’ve brought someone else to this house?”
“Don’t remember for sure. Can’t remember all my passengers.” He quickly counted the money and smiled at Tim|Now it was Mom’s turn to be logical:  “If this is a space ship then they must be spacesuits.”
“Maybe they are bio-suits,” argued Dad.
“They must be both,” concluded Joseph.  “There is only one kind of suit here.”
Mom continued her argument:  “And why would they have a bio-suit and not a spacesuit|He doesn't make me feel uncomfortable or try to flirt with me in front of others. He still winks at me though, which makes me feel special.

One quiet afternoon, Jason and I are alone in his office talking about random things when he brings up Parker's and my relationship.

"So, what exactly is going on with you and Parker|Drake's voice had an edge of steel in it when he spoke. "We won't let her leave. She'll come around."

"We'll see."

Zach moved through the trees, keeping pace with Lexi's progress. Drake was a shadow at his side.

"She doesn't want to forge any kind of mental connection with me," said Zach|A red fox watched me from the tree line on the far side of my parents' house. More surprising than seeing it watch me so seriously was the fact that it was a red fox in the first place. They weren't common in southern Arizona. You were more likely to see a gray fox or one of the silly-looking little desert kit foxes. I stared into this one's yellow-brown eyes and shivered|I want to give you your birthday present."

Danielle let out a slow breath and counted to ten. Monica always did this, stalking her until she felt smothered. Robert had been the same. And that was a timely reminder that the battle for independence had been too hard fought and won.

"I'll be there in a minute, Monica|The sound of motorcycles approaching from the south jolted him into action. 
“Let’s take cover in there,” he waved his gun barrel at a ten-story building with a granite façade. “Quickly.”
Shane jogged behind the others, keeping his gun trained down the street. They made it into the building before he saw the motorcycles|Sarah says sweetly, acting like she had simply forgotten to tell him at some point.

Obviously, it was better that he hadn't known.

"Owww!" Natalie whines, holding her mouth.

"I'm sorry," Blake says. He kisses her cheek and turns back to his sister. "Who the f**k roofied you, Sarah|“Katrina speaks seven languages Captain,” said Johns.  “She speaks Spanish, Arabic, French, Italian, Mandarin, Russian and of course English.  
Katrina looked at Det. Johns with speculation in her eyes.  “You’ve been checking up on me?”
“Not really, just a routine background check.  You were the last one to see your friend alive after all,” said Johns|"How can you know this?" Arjun asked. "Oh, truly I want to believe it. I need her so very much. But how do you know?"

Gremt hesitated. He gestured for Arjun to speak. "Tell me everything."

"Ten years ago, I sat on this veranda with Pandora, and we spoke," said Arjun|And you're looking a little vampy, there." I touch to corner of my mouth and tilt my head toward her and say, "You've got syrup. Or is that drool?"

Mel's back stiffens as she wipes away the blot of red. She points a fork full of pancakes at me and says, "I do not drool|They did not move.

Kress smiled and walked slowly across the battleground, listening to the sounds, the sounds of safety.

Crunch, crackle, crunch.

He lowered his bags to the ground and opened the door to his skimmer. Something moved from shadow into light. A pale shape on the seat of his skimmer|He rolled his eyes and looked away. Jason had his arms over his head, trying to keep the rain off his red hair but I already saw dark spots all over it where the rain had escaped his arms. Emily's pink hair was dry and safely under a hood.
Wait, what?
“Emily, how come you have a hood|She rarely put up any kind of fight as long as she understood what the test was, what it was for, and how it could be of benefit to her. I believe the cream he offered for her dry skin went a long way to winning her over, too. He had teamed up with De. Karl to come up with a concoction, and it was working well. It greatly improved her overall mood. It was hard to be amiable when you're itchy|I realized, in a moment of clarity, that you can't be a published novelist if you don't have any complete novels up for sale.  I ripped through the last few chapters, hardly taking it seriously and mostly just wanting it to be done.
The first literary agent I sent the book to had recently left the business, but found my manuscript laying on the doorsill outside her New York apartment.  She was kind enough to pass it off to a former associate who was just starting up her own agency|“It was so good to get your call.

After Kate pulled up to the hotel entrance, Manda leaned over and gave her a hug.
“I can never thank you enough for your help, Kate|Anna leaned in; kissing Mike gently on his lips before walking off with her drink. 
It was a spark Mike hadn’t felt in years, but couldn’t focus on. Mike spotted Tom and Anthony glancing back from the dance floor. He hid his hatred as he walked towards them.
“Seems like you were having a good night,” Tom smirked as he looked around for Anna|I liked this docile version of her. "You can sleep here, Anna, but not on the ground." I got up and retrieved another mat - the one my mother used before - and set it on the space beside me. "You can lie down here."

She seemed grateful as she took her place on the mat|The Guardian

The Guardian contacted Mr. Castillo en route to Michael's home.
"Hello, sir," said the Guardian.
"Hi, G, what's happened? You generally don't call me, is Katrina okay?" asked Mr. Castillo concern laced in his voice.
"Katrina is fine, but the day we have been preparing for has arrived," said the Guardian|“Sirona’s no healer,” Dichu scoffed. 
“They also make good diviners,” Kellach added. “Among some of the northern tribes, they have a tradition of soothsaying.”

Sirona wanted to shout that aye, she was a seer|In the rest, he’d piled her belongings up to the roof, doing the same on the sides, apparently.

Serenus shook his head as he turned the car into her neighborhood. “It’s not my place to tell you about that; address your questions to Sam.”
“He won’t tell me anything!” she yelled, frustrated.
“He will: give him time,” said Serenus|You have to work at it, like anything else.”
Fiona’s words surprised Claire. Ruth always makes out like being a Mother is the most natural thing. How she wanted kids more than anything and loved Sky from the minute she popped screaming into the world.

“Danger, Inspector?”
“Yes, danger! The day after I question all of the marquis’s servants, a dismissed servant is found dead before I can speak to her. You think that is a coincidence?”

"He's using the battery for ignition." Jake's mind raced. "You said it has a glass face?"

“Mister Anderson,” said Jones after the legal formalities. “Where do you work?”
“I am employed by the United States Department of the Treasury.” This he almost whispered, and not into the witness chair microphone.
“Please, Mister Anderson,” said Jones|The driver hit a button and gave our names. Moments later the massive black iron gates opened.

There was nothing I loved more-besides Jeff and my children-than horses|I don’t know what came over me,” Deke said. “I know you’re as frustrated as I am. I just wish that she was here, Kiran, I mean.

"It was supposed to be a very quick visit," said Gideon|I can’t believe what I’m reading, and I want the message to change so much that I read again, hoping something somewhere along the lines can tell me it’s all a joke.

You’re probably reading this letter because I couldn’t bear to look at you and say goodbye. You’ve always been better than me when it comes to goodbyes|Finally Sophronia said, "You're good at sums and calculating household management. I heard Sister Mattie compliment you the other day.

Right away, Ivy noticed that there was something different about her. For one thing, her cameraman wasn't with her. Also, she was wear- ing the same suit she'd been wearing yesterday, and her hair looked unusually flat.

"I've been looking for you everywhere," said Serena|Spinning around Nikolai searched for something that would help them herd the spiders away, not only from Trunk but also from the tunnel leading outside.  If Trunk were to be confronted with spiders in the confined space of the tunnel there was no way of knowing what might happen.

Jamie double-checked his homework after the dishes were done and announced he was going to bed to read. He read for a while in bed, but couldn't keep his mind on his book. Every time he read a line he kept remembering that his father couldn't read and had given up the chance to learn in order to support his family. He might be growing up, but he was still enough of a kid that he could not quite understand that kind of sacrifice|It was that very moment when I knew if I lied I'd drive him out of my life forever.

"Please don't do this, Brooks|But this is where the trust and the chance come in, Lily. We have a lot to work out, and it won't be easy. But we can do it."

"Can we?"

He stroked the side of her head, the curls springing back after he flattened them.

"I'm falling in love with you, Lily|‘I don’t know if it’s anything to do with case, sir, but the newsagent phoned in to report finding a dead cat in his rubbish bin. He said it had been shot.’ 
‘Shot! Did he find a bullet in it?’
‘Apparently not, sir.’
‘Then what makes him think it’s been shot|He gathered a glass of ouzo, a pitcher of milk, and a small bottle from the cold box. The former was for himself. He found the chilled alcohol more than refreshing. The later items were for Lystus. Alcander measured out a dropper of sedative from the small bottle and added it to the milk. Lystus would drink it despite the bitter taste.
"Here you are," he said to Lystus|Emma shrugged her shoulders like she couldn't care, like she couldn't care about anything anymore.
'Maybe they crossed the road behind the bus?' she said dismissively. 'Or maybe, just like us, the ones you saw crossing the green were just cupping their hands and pretending they'd got themselves a whole new angel.'
She screwed her face in distaste as she sarcastically and angrily said 'a whole new angel|Thank the Messiah that packaged water was available most places. Every little dump of a town or service station had it – but this was isolated country, and he’d not seen any evidence of former habitation for some time. 
No matter, the Heavenly Father would provide for his humble servant. And if He didn’t ... well, then it would be time for the chief acolyte to pass beyond this vale of tears and assume his place at the right hand of the Messiah|“I wrapped the end of the rope that I had in my hand around the radiator and pulled and soon enough his body was hanging in the air. I’ll never forget how his fat face looked when he started to suffocate.”
“And then?”
“Then I took another rope and tied it around his neck and then across the beam to the radiator. All I had to do then was get rid of the first rope|Finn jerked her tightly against him, the pressure of his mouth, his tongue, sending shivers down her spine as he deepened their kiss.

Renna's hands drifted up to tangle in the hair at the base of his neck. She never wanted to let go, but Finn broke away, gasping for breath. Their gazes met, and he smiled slightly.

She shoved a strand of hair behind her ear and tried to normalize her breathing|"Yeah, Ella... I don't think-"

I cover his mouth with my hand. "No. Not because of that. You don't need one because I'm on the Pill."

When I lower my hand from his lips, he doesn't look happy, which I didn't expect.

"Why did you go on the Pill|A second later, Sibyl looked up slowly. Her blond ringlets drooped limply over her shoulders and a haunted shadow darkened her bright blue eyes. She was afraid.

The girl showed no surprise at Nika's arrival, as if she'd been expecting her all along.

"Come and sit with me," said Sibyl|See, he gave me this."

Lucy lifted a pendant over the neckline of her shirt. A simple silver chain, with ... Grace gasped.

It was her necklace!

The periodic element pendant, the one she'd made for her craft project; the one Theo had helped her pack! He must have taken it instead of putting it in the storage box, and ... given it to Lucy|"Town's full of transients. No one's going to report them missing."

True. But still...

"I'll drive you back to the bar," Jessie said. "You can ask around there. I'll take the shops in town."

"How come I have to take the bar|"You're making pie?"

"Apple. Wanna help?"

"Do cows have tails?"

She giggled and started up the steps that led into the living room and kitchen. I left my shoes down by the door and followed behind her.

I would have followed even if she didn't have pie|Gradually some color came back into her face. "My little angel!" she said. "How silly of you to climb so high!"

"Are you okay?" I looked at Mum. "Are you sure it wasn't anything wrong with her?"

"It was a vision," said Mum|He thought he might never stop. "It is fun. But give me a minute to catch my breath. I was worried."

"Coz you were alone?"

Suddenly exhausted, Cole grinned. "Uh-huh."

His small smile comforting, Tate brought his big brother close again. Patting his back, he said, "Don't worry, Cole|I had a birthday, according to my ship clock. But what about theirs? What about their reality? Would I be a freak to them? Would they look on the screen and expect to see a man, grown, bearded or balding with a wife and kids and a career? 
I soaped up my hair and tried not to continue the thoughts|Other than that, there were some dark hallways, but he didn't take her down either so she assumed one was his bedroom and the other his office or a guest room.

He led her directly to the kitchen and told her to sit down on a stool pulled up to a high counter top. Gus poured her a glass of merlot, then pulled ingredients out of the refrigerator and stacked them on the countertops. She watched for a moment, then asked in confusion, "You're going to cook|“I guess so,” said Susan. “We all saw what was happening.”
“Do you honestly think anyone will believe us?” asked Melody.
“They have to,” I replied. “I just wish I would have taken a picture with my phone.”
“There was no time,” said Susan|“Maybe you would get elected Chief,” Tusk offered a happy solution.
But Baer just shook his head. “I don’t want the position. Besides, a Chief would need to be more central so other clans could communicate with him easily throughout the year. Standing-Rock is too far off at the edge of things|Oh, Spirit, at least let his rejection be quick.  People, especially from the outworlds of the Empire, still followed Church teachings closely.  Unless a man speaks his father's tongues...and under stress she had trouble speaking at all.
"You're not a mutant," Bax said.
"Bax, I saw the tests myself, my parents—"
"Lani, you're not a mutant|Are you telling me that this is some kind of disease?" Hank asked, pointing down at the unconscious vampire's bared fangs.
"No, Mr. Evans, not quite exactly," Ishan said in a tone that told Hank it would be in his best interest to be silent a while. Ishan reached out and picked up the body with one hand and gently set it over his shoulder, stood up, and turned to face Hank|Colby signaled King toward the barn. Usually the collie slept curled up on the floor of Ginny's bedroom, but Colby had been so troubled lately, she had taken to using him as a night guard. Paul watched her signal the dog, a frown on his face. "You really are worried, aren't you, Colby|He saw Main Street Station behind the safe and wished he had his mom’s camera to take a picture.
	“Hey, can I borrow your phone?” Dizzy asked Travis. “I want to take a picture of that.”
	“Why?” Travis asked.
	“It looks cool, don’t you think?”
	“Whatever man.” Travis took out his iPhone and handed it to Dizzy|We can have dinner here and just kick back."
"Sounds like a plan to me." Jared retrieved his hat and jacket and I walked him to the door. I rose up on my tippiest tiptoes as he leaned down towards me. We kissed lightly and hugged each other. As he reached the foot of the steps I ran to the edge of the porch and called, "Hey, Jared|It was perhaps one of the more considerate things Cornelia had ever done for him, but Justin had no time to expound on her kindness.

"I ..." He glanced back at Mae, and although she'd transformed into tough praetorian mode for Cornelia's benefit, he still thought he could see a glimpse of that lingering vulnerability. Filled with resolve, hoping he wasn't being an idiot, he turned back to Cornelia|he blinks.

"Dad hated it when I left the lights on," I tell him, casually moving my queen on the middle board forward, presenting her to Lord Loss's rook. "Electricity bills don't pay themselves, you know. Your move."

Lord Loss stares at me, astonished, then down at the board|He didn't think either of them had shallow memories, so maybe it was good that they would see what the Others could do. Maybe it was smart to let them see exactly what stood against them if their people started a fight.

Meg stared at the silver razor she'd placed on the sorting room table. Cs759. A designation for disposable property. Except cassandra sangue shouldn't be property, shouldn't be disposable|“What’s to rethink?” Hardy asked. “Let’s get on the road.”
“I think we may need a little leverage. Your friend, Chance, is liable to get the FBI to listen to him sooner than later.”
“Look,” Hardy said. “We don’t have time to find any leverage|Potters' companion had become a thing of horror, clothing fallen away, a milky bulb arising from his chest to flare with brilliant light.

The screen went blank, came alive again to a view from a slightly different angle.

A quick glance showed that Calapine had dropped all pretense of hiding her eyes, was staring at the screen. Nourse, too, watched through his shoulder prism.

Another blaze of light leaped from the figure in the screen|"There isn't a document in the world that will ever make you an ex around here." Claudette pushed a suitcase aside and sat down on the edge of the bed. "Andre loves you. We all love you."

"And I love all you guys, too," Tasha said in an almost pleading tone.

"Is there no hope for you and Andre|The Librarian thumbed through the bundle of pages, stopping on the final sheet and began reading, “It is our conclusion that much of the work that is currently done in the Library can be out-sourced to contractors, particularly non-skill specific work such as shelving, stacking...”
Lucy gulped and Gillian began to open her mouth to protest again, but the Librarian carried on regardless, his voice becoming louder in order to drown out any potentially dissenting voices, “... blah, blah, blah.  It is our recommendation that a downsizing of the non-essential and part-time members of staff would bring instant economy of scale benefits and would allow for the implementation of a new middle management structure.”
“You mean sacrifice the troops to pay for the generals,” said Gillian|“It’s a few letters scribbled onto a piece of paper.”
“You’re jealous because you don’t have one and I do.”
“I bet you don't have one of these.” Elijah turned and extended the arrow like a fencer ready to score a fatal stab.
“Whoa,” Peter said. His wiry arm reached out to take the arrow|A month or so earlier, she would’ve joined Avery, but not this time. She wanted to spend her last few free days with Sean. Once the production got underway, her days would be booked solid. There wouldn’t be much time for anything personal, even visits with her family.
But with North Salem and Sean miles away, it was time to check in with Avery|Because no matter how important they'd been to me, no matter how sorry people told me they were, Denny and Kat and Teddy weren't my family, and suddenly that distinction had mattered.

Apparently, it still does. Because Mia stops and considers my question. "Maybe not a grief club. But a guilt club. From being left behind."

Oh, don't talk to me about guilt|Your dad paid a moving service to pack up all these flowers, balloons, and gift baskets," Grant said as he pointed to the room full of tokens of everyone's wishes and congratulations. I didn't even realize I had this many people in my life who cared.

A white stuffed lamb caught my attention, and I turned to look up at Grant. "Get the lamb," I told him. He frowned and glanced back at the little lamb|"That's because I didn't want to ruin our moment of sunshine with clouds."

I kissed her shoulder.

"There's nothing I can do at this point, Charlotte. It's over and done with."

She propped herself up with her arms.

"It's not over. You said telling me the truth set you free. If everyone doesn't know the truth, then you're not really free|Howard shook his head. "Not well. Much of it was in the other boat. We will get to the Labyrinth, but we will not have many more hours of light after that."

Light...life...the words were interchangeable to the humans down here.

"I have life - I mean, light|Cassie began to cry, and Adam walked slowly over to her. He put his arm around her torso. "Cassie, I'm sorry you're going through all this. But the Circle can help you now. You're not in this alone."

"That's right." Diana took a step closer and also put her arm around Cassie|“The subtlety is not lost on me. And good.” He handed his now empty glass off to a servant. “And you’ll call on her tomorrow.”
George shook his head. “Really, Sebastian. How in the world did you not scare off Flora?”
“Don’t let this one get away, George|"A ghost is one of the demon-dead whose power has faded to the point where there is still a shape without substance," Rainier said. "What possible use would one be as a servant?"

"Apparently they can light lamps," Surreal replied. "Although you would think they could just stand out of the way and glow|It's more of a flash when it happens to me, a set of images that hit me rapid-fire, one after another, always the same: a long path made of checkered purple-and-tan stones, opening to a wide-open area, palm trees, parked cars, bikes whizzing by, the sun high in the sky overhead. Then a set of five wide steps leading to a courtyard of some sort, framed with archways, archways, archways never-ending, and beyond them a larger courtyard. Red flowers. A flash of dark figures standing in a circle.

They used to scare me, the dark figures|Can I come over?”
“Okay.” I pocket my phone. “Let’s get this over with.”
“Sarah.”
“What?”
My mom shakes her head. “Get this over with...you say it like it’s a chore.”
“No, mom, it’s not a chore|‘I think you are right Arnold’, said Pearl not giving anything away. 
The quartz was pulsing a very bright blue now with Louie, Lulu and Pearl in close proximity. As with the Ten Ants, Arnold had no perception of the phenomenon that was occurring. In fact he was wondering why everyone was hanging around looking at the quartz|The Gruagach stopped in mid-step and whirled around to glare at the back of Vanora’s head. Angus put a finger to his lips. “Hush, it heard you.”
Vanora’s cheeks turned crimson. “Oops.”
The hairy creature returned, pushing a silver dessert cart loaded with steaming hot pudding, tea cakes and powdered donuts. It placed a covered dish in front of Angus and another in front of Vanora|It was sobering to realize that the most accurate perception of dinosaurs had also been the first. Back in the 1840s, when Richard Owen first described giant bones in England, he named them Dinosauria: terrible lizards. That was still the most accurate description of these creatures, Malcolm thought. They were indeed like lizards, and they were terrible|Stay here and wait in the barroom, oh and don’t acknowledge Lucas if you see him.”
“When will you be back?” Dylan asked.
“In about an hour, we must make first contact,” and then they disappeared into the crowds leaving Connor and Dylan to check themselves into the inn.
Kaitlin and Bell checked themselves into an inn one street over and Lucas went on to walk around the block to get back to Dylan|“I see that you’ve included non-pharmaceuticals.” An observation. Perhaps a question.
“It is across the boards,” said Simmons. “From fast foods to hospital admissions. Sales are down all over.”
“She’s delivered quite a blow to consumption,” said Matthews.
“One way of putting it,” said Simmons|He drew a slow, steady breath and blew it through pursed lips, forcing his balled fists to remain at his sides. Mustering all the self-control he possessed, he muttered, "You are mistaken. Lady Cordelia is in no need of a protector. Not now, not ever. Assume what you must, but stay away from the lady|"We refused to acknowledge him or your marriage, or even let him speak to us about settlements," Lady Scranton said, sniffling. "We shut him out for stealing you from us. I thought he'd gloat about our ruin, laugh at us when we were forced to live in the gutter."

"Then you read Mac very wrong. He would never do such a thing. And you will not have to live in the gutter|My offer to release her is more generous than you give me credit for."

I was taken aback. It was the first time I could remember him pulling rank on me. My familiarity with him often made me forget who he was. Whenever anyone at The Shade treated him with deference, I found it downright weird. The idea of calling him 'your highness' or even 'prince' seemed ridiculous to me, but sitting there, it hit me full force: the vampires recognized Derek as their prince and he was no pushover|"There is a big fluffy bed in the master bedroom that I think you'd enjoy." I loved the way his voice rumbled through his chest. "Besides, no one is steering the boat."

I traced my fingers along his chest, traveling the ravines and rises of his muscles. It was a landscape I wanted to live in forever. He wiggled out from underneath me, standing to dress so he could take care of the boat|But he was bent upon going, and as I hate to be officious, I said no more; but my heart quite ached for him at every jolt, and when we got into the rough lanes about Stoke, I was quite in an agony about him. And then the poor horses too! You know how I always feel for the horses|I would like to start the bidding at ten thousand dollars," the auctioneer said to the crowd.

I'm pregnant. I'm going to give birth to Isaac Welch's baby.

Stop thinking or panicking, and stare at the work being sold. This is good business. The baby can wait.

Only nine months.

Long enough.

Noelle stood back, tears in her eyes as she looked at the painting she'd done of herself after her time with Isaac|“Yeah, like we missed that one in college.  It was all we could do to get your nose out of your books long enough to come up for air.”  Jan poked Cheri in the ribs and they both laughed.
“I wasn’t that boring, was I?”
“No, honey, you weren’t boring|Leopards, cheetahs, lynx, tigers, cougars, bobcats, servals, and lions occupied the habitats, along with one small raccoon-like creature that lay curled protectively inside a hollow log, as if it smelled the fact that it was the only omnivore in the place.

Zane kept an eye on Ty as they moved through the facility. He felt sorry for his partner, sort of, but he was also amused. Ty seemed to have developed an extra nervous twitch the closer they got to the animals|In the distance people were running up stairs and shouting. 'You put this on! And you stay down real low, Walter Plinge. One man in a mask is pretty much like another, after all. And when they chase you, Greebo... give them a run for their money. Do it right and there could be-'

'Yurr, I knoaow,' said Greebo despondently, taking the mask|{Soon, several hours and he'll be fully back with you.}
Once more the image repeated itself.
Merlin sighed. He found himself unable to communicate the concept to the owl.
{Merlin?}
{Anguis, I'd nearly forgotten about you.}
An image appeared of Anguis staring at the owl|I would have recognized his voice,” Anne said.
“What did you have in the car besides your groceries?”
“My purse.  I have a small yellow leather purse.  Did you find it?”
“Yes, we found the purse but the contents are scattered around the car.  Do you remember what was in the purse|Carda tapped a little of everything into the bowl. "I told her I was making steak rub."
Michelle leaned over the bowl and sniffed. "Smells more like focaccia bread."
"Maybe the person making up this spell was from Italy, I don't know." 
Carda called fire and lightning to his hands and passed them over the bowl|He always found it humorous that other Carpathians feared Gregori, Mikhail's second in command, best friend and son-in-law, but found his older brothers so approachable when they were at least as dangerous, if not more so.

Lucian gripped his forearms in a warrior's greeting. Gregori's older brother looked fit and strong, his eyes gleaming, piercing through Mikhail straight to his soul as if he could read inside any man.

"It is good to see you again after all this time, Mikhail|"All right, Quarrel. But first we must have something to eat. And I'm damned if I'm going to be scared off the island before I've had a good look. We'll take Honey with us." He turned to the girl. "Is that all right with you, Honey|In fact, though I don't have the evidence available right now, there are corners of the planet here and there, in various University and sectoral settings mostly, where what we might call 'sympathy celebrations' of one sort or another are taking place. The celebrations are still continuing and will endure for another day at least."

"Are you telling me that this is a Trantor-wide celebration|I watched them, bemused as they continued to tussle for a few minutes more before stopping. They were both breathing a little heavier but their smiles were wide and very genuine. The smile on Aaron's face transformed him completely. Suddenly he wasn't so intimidating.

"Carrie, this is my brother, Aaron|As he lay sprawled on the ground, he was amazed to find that he was completely dry, but a moment later all such thoughts were driven from his mind, a sharp twinge in his right side making him sit up, hesitant and bewildered. 
My hand! he remembered, examining it, but there was no sign of any injury|Hodgesaargh glanced again at the flame burning steadily in its saucer, and then, handling the crackling pages with care, turned to 'F'.

After some browsing, he eventually found what he was looking for under 'P'.

Back in the mews, in the deepest shadow, something cowered.

There were three shelves of books in Agnes's cottage. By witch standards, that was a giant library|It was a collaborative effort among many official and non-official individuals.”
“Your future son-in-law is very modest,” Mai said to Ana.
“He’s not the future son-in-law,” said Zoe. “We are just friends.”
Tuan nodded his head to show his agreement, but he was blushing.
“He acts like he’s her boyfriend,” said Mai|He told us you're not at home, that he has no idea where you are, and that you broke up with him for someone named Luke. No last name, nothing. If Jonathan hadn't heard you mention a Luke recently, we wouldn't have been able to track you down."

Jonathan was probably laughing his head off. "Tell him he was right about Luke|If a patient described this to me, I'd begin probing immediately for the source of the delusional material.

"I used to walk lip here when I was a child," Ruth said. "That was before they put in the lights for the night parties. I hated it when they put in the lights|"You can pay me back someday," said Alcander.
"That's a deal."
Alcander paid for the lockets, and Lystus didn't offer the sales girl a parting smile like he usually would.
"Do you have your kit with you?" Lystus asked at once when they had reached the street.
"No, I'll have to stop at work for it," said Alcander|Are you thinking about taking someone special?” 
	“Well, I was thinking about it, but if it’s…. uh…. lame, then you know, it’s not a big deal,” Seth answered nonchalantly.
	“No, it’s not lame. I mean, I don’t think it’s lame|There was no introduction for the new kids - and Luce couldn't decide whether she was glad about that or not.

Mr. Cole merely slapped syllabi down on each of the four new students' desks. When the stapled packet landed in front of Luce, she leaned forward eagerly to take a look. History of the World, it read.

Circumventing the Doom of Mankind. Hmmm, history had always been her strongest subject, but circumventing doom|Robert turned slowly to face her, his eyes wild.
“Stay out of this, Claire. You’ve had nothing to do with the boys all their lives; don’t start playing Auntie now; it doesn’t suit you.”
“It suits me better than father suits you. When did you become such a monster, Robert|Listen, we’ve found a rear gate in the fence–”
“Sal!”
“–We can pull it down with a rope I found in the car. It’s all quiet here so I don’t think–”
“Sal!”
“–anyone has seen us. I’m sure it’ll be–”
“Sal|She handed him over to Aaron.
Though both brothers had a moment of animosity, Scott still accepted Aaron’s shoulder.
After Aaron shored up his stance to support Scott, wrapping an arm around his brother’s back, he turned to Anna.
It was hard to describe his expression. “You shouldn’t have done that, Anna|Go beyond the mere sensations of touch, venture deeper, into the very roots of the hairs that cover your body to feel the energy of your own life-force.’
Petr allowed his mind to drop deeper into probing relaxation. At first he could hear only the wind. As he became more relaxed all external sounds died away so that he could hear his heart's rhythm. Finally there was silence.
Yassap took a step closer, ‘You are doing very well, Petr|Gone was whatever was left of Seth's purity and innocence, and in its place was the soulless shell of a man that now hated me, me the reason he suffered, the reason he had lost that vital, good part of himself.

Me the reason all had been taken from him.

"As it turns out, I'm not the only one anxious to move on from the stipulations of our agreement," Aliah continued. He was addressing me, but I couldn't tear my eyes away from Seth|"He has my heart," she stated simply, closing the door of her apartment with a small smile.

Glancing at the clock on the wall of her apartment, Asha knew she'd have to hurry to get ready for her dinner date with Kade. A rush of adrenaline and excitement flooded her body as she moved quickly to the bathroom to shower. Not that Kade would mind if she was late|Maybe next time you see her, she'll be lucid and having a good day."

She nodded. "I hope you're right."

Even if he wasn't sure, he knew giving Madison hope couldn't hurt. "Talk to her," he said. If anyone needed to express herself, it was Madison|"Back when we started these sessions." He slides the paper across the desk at me.

I stare down at the paper that definitely has my signature, yet I can't remember signing it. There's no date on it either to remind me. I drag my fingers down my face. "Well, I didn't know what I was signing|“All right guys, go untie the lines from the dock, bow first.
“Who left you in charge Seth?”  Evan looks at me.
I almost say that’s Captain Seth, but I let it go for now and just clutch the wheel.  A minute later we are free from the dock|It reflects an over-supply of art, from an economic viewpoint. Paintings, music, writings, sculptures, you name it; they're mostly dirt-cheap." 
"What magnificent object is depicted here?" he asked, pointing to the tree in the foreground of Marge’s landscape painting. 
"That's a larch tree," explained Marge|Fantastic, thought the director, who would love to have my job right now.
“OK, this is what we are going to do.  Send a Gentech squad to the Palace keep it under surveillance and watch for the girl and her companion.  We see them, take the girl, before they have a chance to enter the Palace.  The Esperanzi stays on her tail – we need him to confirm that they’re heading to the Palace|He ran his fingertips over the satin finish, knowing it must have belonged to his father.

Taking the wand with him, he left his mother's room. Now that Cara's parents knew who he was, it was unlikely that he would ever be able to get close to her again.

Frowning thoughtfully, Anton ran his thumb over the wand|It was better if he didn't move.

"So, you have decided to wake up?" Howard's smile was so warm that Gregor couldn't help smiling back. The muscles on his face felt stiff and unused.

"What happened?" Gregor asked.

"You were rescued from the Dead Land by a pair of daring adventurers, who risked all to carry you back to our doctors," said Howard|All I can think about is what I want, which has nothing to do with getting out of this box, suddenly. "Feel my heartbeat. Can you feel it?"

"Yes."

"Feel how steady it is?"

I smile into her shoulder. "It's fast."

"Yes, well, that has nothing to do with the box|“Well, no surprise there, Bean, because she didn’t tell them who she was.”
“Oh, man, I’ve really got to take a dump, Mike,” I said as we approached our front stoop.
“Then go for it, Bean.”
“I’m sorry I got you mixed up in all of this, Mike|With a square of late-afternoon sun on the floor, even the red room showed itself to be what Beau had described, a dusty collection of old things. Sam took up a broom and swept the white stones and bundled herbs into a harmless pile. The stiff snake went into a garbage bag. It was a little creepy, picking it up, but she handled it just fine. She dropped the black candles—so dusty that they were nearly gray, in the clear light of day—into the same bag with the snake|But how would she ever pull it off?
Andy looked more confused than anything else. He seemed more upset about his sisters’ crying. Abby wondered how much he knew or how much he could comprehend. 
Abby looked at Lizzie and saw that she was actually not crying. She was holding on to Abby like the others, but she wasn’t crying|He collided with an invisible wall. He pushed against it, straining to break through. He threw all of his energy against it, but was unable to decipher its composition. Helel stood watching his efforts with nonchalance.
‘He was trying to manipulate you, Gadreel. And if I didn't come, he may have succeeded|"I'm here for him." I hitch my finger over my shoulder at Luke and give the skinny guy one of my best charming smiles.

The skinny one frowns, unimpressed, and crosses his arms. "Your friend broke the rules and he's got to pay for it." He leans to the side to look at Luke|She closed her eyes and turned away. “I know that my son will be safe with you and your family, and I hope that you can forgive me.”
“I will not forgive you for being so foolish. Don’t give up!” Habala insisted.
Kala opened her eyes and turned back to Habala|“Yes,” replied Greg, “And I still need that favor.  Or do I need to tell your mother why you missed church last Sunday?”
“You wouldn’t,” came Jack’s panicked voice.
“That favor?”
“Oh all right,” said Jack, “What do you need?”
“I need you to look up the file on that college girl who was murdered last year,” said Greg|Because eventually, no matter what the circumstances, he would see the real me. Josh is a beautiful, messy, passionate work of art, and I'm...a blank canvas.

There's nothing here to love.

"You told him that you're a placeholder in his life," Kurt says. "So does that make me or Josh the placeholder in yours|'Very simple reason, Tribune," I said to the Legate. "It's no state secret. Rome is so dependent upon Egypt for corn that the Emperor wants to prevent the country from ever falling under the control of a powerful traitor. Surely you grew up as I did in dread of another Civil War."

"I put my faith in our Generals," said the Legate|I can't believe I was such a grouch for this time of year." He cleaned up the mess then took her hand in his and walked her up the stairs. "I've got something to give you. It's something I had specially made for you."

Lily sat on the bed as he went to get his gift|She pushed the match under the twists of newspaper she'd prepared, picked up her wrench, and darted into a gap between the boiler and a cabinet.  She swung the cabinet door wide, hiding herself, and waited.
The soft scuff of boot heels came to her straining ears.  She held her breath and tightened her grip on the wrench|‘This is Penmel’s initiative, not mine. Besides, it doesn’t say anything dangerous. We are perfectly safe,’ Gadreel answered.
‘You are a quick study. I had better watch you. This is great work!’ Helel embraced him fiercely. ‘You are my right hand, Gadreel|“Just that it didn’t work out…”
Sarah sat back in her chair and pushed a few strands of hair out of her face.  “I bet that’s what he was doing in Reno when I saw him at the hotel.”
“Yeah.  Maybe he’d just been visiting his boy…”
“…Ah…”
“Does that change the way you think about him, Sarah|Come on, Mike, even those people aren’t self-absorbed enough to do something like that.”
“They did that sort of thing while in college. How different would it be to blackmail someone in “real-life,” especially when they know where to strike? But the question I had was whether you knew anything about this?”
With a sigh, Kyle crossed his legs, and said, “Please, Mike|She ran the tip of her tongue along the curve of her lip. "Take my picture," she said.
He blinked.
"Take it now."
He raised an eyebrow. "But there are so many people here."
"Let them watch."
His eyes flashed with humour, and zest. He ran one finger along the top of his camera|After her confrontation with Coach Hill in the hardware store this morning, she feared there might not be a friendly voice at the other end of the line. Her homecoming had obviously stirred up as much anger as she'd anticipated.

"Lucky?"

"Yes?"

"It's Mike."

Lucky pulled the blanket she'd curled up in more tightly around her. "What can I do for you, Mike|That was why he did not go back to Ireland.

He splashed a bit more brandy into his glass. There were a hundred reasons why he did not go back to Ireland. Fifty, at least.

He took a sip, then another, then drank deeply until he was too sotted to continue his dishonesty.

There was one reason he did not go back to Ireland|It was simply impossible. The Empire had grown to Britannia in the North, beyond Parthia in the East; it covers Northern Africa. If you want to be a good Roman, Antony, then stand up and speak your conscience in the Senate. Tiberius invites this."

"Oh, Father, you are much deceived," said Antony|Instead, we wound deeper into the keep until we stood at a set of glass doors leading out to some sort of garden or atrium.

"Our lord is outside," explained one of the guards, about to open the doors.

Volusian blocked his way. "Get a herald to announce her. She's not a prisoner anymore. And use her titles."

The man hesitated, glanced at me, and then called for a herald|"But why not? That's what makes a shopping trip so much fun."

"I really couldn't-"

"Oh, come on, Carson."

"I shouldn't-"

"Please, Carson. Pretty please, for me," Leah cajoled.

"Come on and try it on, Carson|No longer was he reduced to watching security footage all day or patrolling the perimeter of the base. Now he was inside, in the holding cells below ground where all the action was. He would finally be allowed to meet his first Werewolf, and the excitement sent his heart racing.
Each cell was nothing more than a cage made of glass. Granted, the glass was strong enough to stand against tornados and bullets, but it was still glass|I squatted back down so I was face to face with Steve. He didn't look so brave anymore. The tip of the stake was pointing down at the ground, a threat no more, and his whole body sagged miserably. I felt sorry for him.

"Why did you come here, Steve|“Okay, hop onto the windowsill now.” His order came from too far for me to feel comfortable.
I gathered every ounce of bravery stored within my shaking body and climbed over my bed onto the sill. My gaze focused on the task and the bird, but never outside. Not standing halfway steadily, I reached outside and lifted the bird|Your young friend. They knew about Robbie Henderson after all. Wesley's heart sank.

"Is there some sort of power controlling all this? There is, isn't there? When I accessed UR BOOKS for the first time, I saw a tower."

"All things serve the Tower," the man-thing in the yellow duster said, and touched the hideous button on its coat with a kind of reverence|The Palace and Gentech will want to use you like a lab mouse, you and I deserve a life, a happy life and I’m willing to protect wanting that, let alone having it.”  He sighed then.  
“Lily, you came from somewhere.  You didn’t come from Gentech or from the Palace|Ray and Forrest exchanged looks that conveyed nothing because neither had a clue what the other was thinking.

"I guess he changed his mind," Harry Rex said.

"What was in the other will?" Ray asked.

"I can't tell you. He was my client, so it's confidential|I had no doubt had we been inside, and not standing in front of the house when the van with the rest of the guys in the band pulled up, that they would have interrupted something a lot more intimate than us kissing.

Someone honked the horn and Jet pulled away. He left a little bite to remember him by and now, instead of being angry, those oh-so-pretty eyes with that gold halo just looked sad.

"Bye, Ayd."

I had to hold back tears. I put his shaking fingers to my mouth, like maybe I could hold him there, keep him with me forever, and whispered back, "Bye, Jet|"You've given me a great gift today, Emily," he told her.

"How so?"

He paused for a moment as he wondered how he might best explain himself to her. "I feel as though I've been hearing music around me all my life without actually listening to it. You've taught me how to listen, Emily|If you fail, I will have no option but to send in the Elite Corps.'
Tommy crossed his eyes and stuck out his tongue. Jessica tried not to laugh. 'We shall not fail, sir. You may tell Roman and his colleagues that their services will not be required.'
'I hope that proves to be the case, Jessica|Yet fear kept my feet rooted to the floor inside.
His arms still braced against the wood, Julian cocked his head while one of his brows arched up. Not bothered by my concern, he eased onto the insecure railing, his gray sneakers dangling two feet above the floorboards.
His gaze mocked me like it suggested I come out of my room and make him get off the railing|On a lighter note, Dorrie said we can go visit Emmet soon. She spoke to his doctor and he said Emmet has been settling into a new routine and living arrangement and would like a few more weeks. I wonder if Emmet said that, or if the doctor just assumed he needed more time. The mentally ill don’t have much of a voice|Jennifer screamed out for help as the woman’s dirty and jagged fingernails threatened to pierce her skin. As she began to feel the oxygen leaving her lungs and see bright flashes of light on a black background she swung her bat, connecting it with the young woman’s leg. The woman’s femur, brittle and exposed, split in half. The woman let out a unearthly scream, more out of defeat than pain, and loosened her grip on Jennifer|"I would speak to you privately," Bowen said, casting a glance around at the others milling about.

The worry in her eyes deepened, but she nodded hesitantly and awaited Bowen's directive.

He led her through the great hall, annoyance biting at him when he saw no place where people weren't congregated. He stepped outside the back of the keep, where, finally, he spied an area near the bathhouses, where it was quiet and private|He grinned. "I most definitely mean you." But Rick sobered fast because he had something more pressing to discuss with her. "Kendall, what kind of relationship did you have with Brian?"

She stiffened in her seat, laughter replaced by intensity. "I don't think that's relevant|"Yes, it's not like you guys own werewolves or anything," Hunter said.

"Be nice," Leopold said.

"I mean the legend thing." Hunter sighed. "It happened in Huntington, too."

"What happened?"

"Werewolves. Apparently your Legend's Run werewolf - or werewolves - made his way to Huntington|"Tony has ties?" It didn't fit my picture of the charmer I knew.

"He's Catholic," Jude said, watching my fingers slide down the tie. "And his mom calls him every Sunday to make sure he went to mass. So yeah, Tony's got a shitload of ties|She sounded coy, but the look in her eyes could only be read one way. She wanted me as much as I wanted her.

"I thought I'd take you for a flight."

"A flight, huh?"

"Sound good?" I watched her, assuming she knew I was talking about two different kinds of flights|Feeling somewhat embarrassed, Ana shifted slightly in her seat.
“Mom, she works there,” said Vo. “Ana is a photographer during the day. She won a contest recently.”
“Did you major in photography in college?” said Lan.
“I didn’t go to college,” said Ana|There was some beeping from the holo, then a voice. 
"Welcome, Jacob."
"Ha!" Alistair jumped up and pointed at the now blank terminal screen. "I did it, Bradley! Stick that in your circuits and choke on it!" He was grinning broadly as he handed me the holo|“We’re already beyond repair,” Simmons pointed out, thanks to Jones.
Callahan, who now had no further doubts as to why he was there, said, “We’ll need a month at least. It will have to be meticulously planned, and can only involve our most trusted.”
“We don’t have a month,” said Simmons|If, as Tabitha said, Simi knew who he was, why would she do such a thing?

"Is she fighting with Ash?" he asked, hoping, praying it was a possibility.

"No, Nick. You're not that lucky."

He cursed again. "I have to tell him," he said to Tabitha|I re-read several times the two pages there were on defending against a Baobhan and I wished that I had not counted on this book having all the answers. I smelled terrible I was sure and so I took a quick shower. 
Toryn was in my room when I came out wrapped in a burgundy towel. “Get out of my room, Toryn|“It’s called Maps of the Skies: A Complete Guide to Nimbus,” said Jude.
“Where did you get that book?” Dirk asked. He had a strange, knowing look in his eye. “That book has been banned for a century.”
“I brought it up from Burrow 12,” said Jude|"I was just kidding," he defended.

"Hey," Drew said, coming up behind me, slipping his arms around my waist.

"I was just talking about taking them surfing with us this spring," Jay told Drew.

"Really? You want me to teach you how to surf|That evening, Mercy started to say good-night and head for the library. Sister Helen cleared her throat and prompted, “Your room is that way.” She pointed toward the passage that led to the back entrance of the convent.”
“Do I have to go to the chapel?”
Sister Helen shook her head. “There is no requirement that you go to the chapel|Her natural scent had begun to filter through the fragrant oils from her bath, and he fumbled with the tie of her robe, impatient to remove it and sniff every inch of her nak*d body.

His topcoat was in the way, and he released her temporarily, stil keeping contact with her luscious mouth as he shrugged out of his coat and dropped it to the floor.

Freed of that burden, he worked her out of the robe|You are certainly bound to become your father’s predecessor, and an opportunity on such scale is foolish to simply discard. If you do manage to land in the high chair, your project will become much easier.”
“No,” Gralso said sourly, and the doctor nodded.
“I see. You would search for your wife even if I showed you her corpse, but the search is already too painful for you, Gralso|Obviously, she still had her questions, and he could understand that.
She looked angry.  Her brown eyes had narrowed and her lips had thinned.  He looked forward to her anger.
From his coat pocket, Steele pulled out a wide, locking leather collar.  The brunette’s eyes moved from his face to the collar|I don’t necessarily agree with your methods, but I can now accept why you did it.”
Tessa hugged her father. “Thank you, Papa. It’s a good life here. We’re not the richest people when it comes to money, but Dean is a hard worker and he’s loves me and the children.”
“I can see that he’s a good man, Tessa|"Give it back," Meg said, pulling on one end of a catalog as hard as she could while Nathan pulled on the other end. "Give ... it ... back!"

"Stop," Simon said. What are you doing?>

It made her angry,> Nathan replied. He stopped pulling but didn't let go of his end of the catalog|So different from the Clint his reputation painted. This had to be the true man. The one he wanted to be. So, why did he act so differently with others—bigger than life, daunting yet charming? A charm almost expected of him.
She smiled back. "I loved being a part of this, Clint|Well before anything else metal was known."
"You know," said Alicia, "For a couple of years now I've been worrying about that transition to the bronze age, not that it's entirely relevant."
"Yeah?" Frank prompted her.
"Well, Bronze is mostly ninety per cent copper and ten percent tin to help it keep an edge better," said Alicia|“He can’t be,” Jawen said, shaking her head. “He was not born out of wedlock. He’s got a mother and a father, just the same as the rest of us, and they were married to each other when they had Basha and Oaka, I’m sure of it.” 
“But how can you be so sure, Jawen|“It’s supposed to be the truth,” answered her daughter. “It is the truth.”
Melissa looked over to Ananda for support, surely he saw reason.
“What she said,” said Ananda, pointing at Ruth with his fork.
“This is not funny,” said Melissa.
“It wasn’t meant to be,” said Ananda|Cameron, who was sitting in the backseat, got a real kick out of it.

It was perfect. I wouldn't have changed a thing.

Iris and Cameron had come home, and they'd brought my home with them.

SOME HAPPY MONTHS LATER

My mother and father were shocked but thrilled when they found out they had a grandson. They had given up on that possibility years ago, which made it doubly joyful for them to be grandparents|When the two parts of the stone had cooled enough for him to place the bars back into the base, he put the capstone back on the top and wondered what he would do with this bonus. Back to his bed again, he slipped the second ugly but valuable rough stone under his pillow.
He pulled a large white padded envelope from the drawer to contain the stone|On the coffee table before them, Langdon's leather bag was still open, the golden capstone peeking out the top. The words Eight Franklin Square had now faded away, leaving no evidence that they had ever existed.

Katherine had pleaded with Sato to let her go see her brother, but Sato had simply shaken her head, eyes fixed on Bellamy's cell phone. It sat on the coffee table and had yet to ring|Anytime we get together for the holidays, it's a monumental event.

To keep it from being a nightmare for her in the kitchen, we're assigned dishes to make for dinner.

Rae and I are responsible for a dessert this year.

Which we aren't prepared to make.

I open the paper Devin gave me and find a recipe|She could hear the click of the cameras as she passed, but she let Catalina continue her run down the beach. She wanted to take the edge off this fiery little horse’s energy and get to know her a bit to be able to handle her in front of the cameras. As she tried to slow Catalina for another turn down the beach, the horse suddenly grabbed the bit between her teeth and stretched out in a dead run down the beach, away from the cameras|She knew this from experience. Sometimes she wondered if maybe the angel was a kind of guardian, in which case Haley probably shouldn't be working all that hard to get her back to Heaven.

On the other hand, having a weepy guardian angel was kind of a pain. People thought Haley was crazy because most of them couldn't even see the angel|Around the base, at least a dozen tunnels led out from it like the spokes on a bicycle wheel.

"Oh, great," said Gregor. "Now which way?"

Ares had no idea. "But, Overlander, it has been many hours since we fed. If we are to continue, we must eat|In the distance, a small red boat was pulling up, and I knew we were going to rush off to the challenge soon.

He did have a point, though. Even after a belly full of coconut, I was still weak and shaky and he looked exhausted too. We could use a little energy before the challenge and to cement our deal together. So I got up, brushed the sand off my bottom, and glanced over at the boat|She watched her tall, naturally thin father scarf down a couple of donuts and drink his stone black coffee. The donuts were left over from last night, his dinner.... The way he ate disgusted her, yet all her lecturing wasn’t going to stop him. She grabbed her protein shake from the fridge; it was barely cold.
“Dad, we really, really need a new fridge|Time had passed, although I didn't have a good notion of how much. She looked over her shoulder, and I saw Joanne following her out of the building.

"So," she was saying, "What do you think? Hot Topic? And maybe some Abercrombie. Then lunch."

"Girl, do you ever do anything but shop|For the first time, his attention is far away, off of me.  
“I remember thinking that it didn't seem scary,” he continues. “Nothing had happened or anything. But we turned around anyway to go back to the States, just because someone told us we should be scared.”
He refocuses on me. “What I actually remember most from that trip is crossing back into the States|A woman with the name Rachel on her nametag greets us, then has us go into what's called a group therapy room to wait for my mom. It makes me feel stiff and uncomfortable, because we had mandatory group therapy sessions when I was in jail. I have to remind myself that this isn't jail|He needed to be with Kate, but he also needed to return to his friends and let them know what was happening. He turned down a dark alley and walked partway down and out of sight of the street. He looked around to ensure he was alone as he reached into his cloak and pulled out the crystal from within.
As he closed his eyes to concentrate on the crystal, he couldn’t keep his mind off Kate|She's been staying at my place, but she went back home this morning."

"Thanks." Jesse jumped to his feet and headed for the front door.

An hour later, Bella was curled up on her couch feeling sorry for herself when a knock at the door sounded. Her head snapped up. She knew without even looking out the window that it was Jesse|“I, uh … I wonder if you’ve heard the story of the Wrekin?” asked Sigurd quickly. “That lovely hill, just beyond your doorstep?”
“Well, I suppose I haven’t heard your version of it.” Alfric bit down on a juicy cherry.
“Then I must certainly enlighten you,” said Sigurd|“You know, Laura, what if someone had died? What would that comment make you, then?”
Laura looked around at her friends and turned to Victoria. “It would make me right.” Laura’s sassy reply made everyone laugh.
“True,” Victoria said calmly. “But also extremely insensitive and rude… what happened to you, Laura|Three blocks away, some people always let a big German Shepherd roam their small front yard in the evenings.  Probably the person got home from work, and let the dog out to go to the bathroom.  
Jessie always went around this dog.  She would be a tiny snack to the dog, like an after-dinner mint.  But this night she was in such a hurry that she was left with no choice – she had to pass the dog|For a minute I keep perfectly still, savoring the feel of his body against mine, the hair on his legs a delicious counterpoint to my smooth skin, his breath in my hair, the steady thump of his heart under my cheek. I lift my head to look at him. He's awake-he's a morning person, one of his many flaws. His eyes are warm as he gazes down at me.

"Morning," I say, my voice rough with sleep.

"Yes," he says, an affirmation, Yes, it is morning|"Well, I was about to buy coffee..."

"That's perfect. And it can't hurt or anything." Smiling, I squeezed her arm. "Do it for me, so I'll feel like I've given you a good-luck charm."

"Okay. Sure. I'll take it as soon as I get the coffee|She glanced at the door. No lock. Good. That meant she wouldn't be tempted. Not that she was. Not even a tiny bit.

He sat on the table beside hers, knees splayed, palms planted beside his thighs, which left his privates at eye level. He made no attempt to lie down or cover himself with the sheet|The swift black shape of the Captain’s rocket whips tail-first out of the sky and glides downward to land exactly where it took off.  In a moment the backward movement of everything is happening so fast she can’t see or hear anything clearly.  Then, it slows and stops. 
Now she is on the beach bidding goodbye to Gailus.  She walks casually up a boarding ramp to get into the rocket|“That’s great!” Willow gave him a hug. She had been nervous about it all day, watching the clock as it slowly crept toward 3:45.
“Band,” Tommy said, nodding. He pulled a folder out of his backpack and took it over to the table. Willow knew this meant he would like her to sit down, so she obliged, and looked at the folder|A night like tonight is the perfect cover for them to do business. It is so loud and crazy no one would notice anything suspicious going on. Charlie and I headed towards the back where the doorway to the backroom was. We were right that there would be a guard. He was trying not to look like a guard|The Maitre D’ waited as Kathy sat before helping her move closer to the table.
“Thank you,” Kathy said.
The Maitre D’ looked at John and smiled.  “I understand you’re celebrating a special occasion with us this evening.”
“Yes, we are.  In fact, it’s our 12th wedding anniversary.”  John glanced at Kathy and wondered if she had mentioned it when she called for the reservation|Blinking her eyes, he saw herself in a grey room that was grey all around. He saw with annoyance that standing watching was the Keos’ Queen with her arms folded and her black eyes were narrowed. She he saw in her mind sensed a flash of light as Geelley came into the room from the opening. He saw she looked before resuming looking at the Queen|We’re supposed to be staking out this Gordo’s,” he jerked his impossibly cleft chin at the downtown Gordo’s “restaurant” before which they stood, “so I might as well get something here.”
A man dressed as a ninja and wreathed in flame ran past, trailing smoke.
“A foul omen!” said Goodspeed.
“That happens,” said Duke.  “A lot.”
“The spirits in this place are dark indeed.”
“That’s the Hamwiches,” said Duke|Was it all you wanted it to be?"

I turned to glare at him. "Don't you already know? Didn't your two goons fill you in?"

"My goons?" He laughed. I hated how much I loved that deep sound. "I can't wait to tell Jared you called him a goon|He filled out the card, punching his name last, and then exited the voting booth. A woman handed him an I'm a North Carolina voter sticker with a toothy grin. He slapped it proudly on his suit and then walked outside.

Liz was waiting for him. She looked giddy from the experience. "I just did my civic duty," she told him triumphantly, pointing at her own sticker|Nevo's gauge was his own family, and he could well imagine the talk there would be when it got out that Joram had declared war.

"On who?" his father would demand, looking dumbstruck. "On a people whose king he doesn't even know the name of?"

"If there is a king." His mother. "I've heard they have a queen|“I’m going to Germany,” said Ruth. “I’ve been invited by the Humboldt University of Berlin. They want me to address the faculty, students and guests.”
“And you’ve accepted?” Though Roth strongly suspected the answer.
“I have,” said Ruth.
“Pretty much the opposite of lying low, then,” said Roth|"No."

"But there is a lover who is causing some grief?"

"Yes." I twisted around to look at him. "How did you guess that? Are you a telepath?" And if he was, how was he reading me? Quinn - the lover I'd mentioned before - couldn't, and yet he was not only one of the most powerful vampires I'd met, but also one of the most powerful telepaths|The restaurant smelled amazing. Her stomach agreed.

The maitre d' led them past the other diners to a private corner table, and all the while Ari wondered about Jai's surprising language skills and whether a maitre d' was called such in Italy, considering the word was French. Hmm.

Once they were seated with menus and water, Ari arched an eyebrow at Jai|Dad continued to search in vain for a hidden actuator and tried all kinds of whistles in an attempt to open the airlock door.
Joseph tried whistling, but to no avail.

Thomas had no idea how long they had been there, the minutes may have stretched into hours; he felt weak.  He stood in front of the airlock door; he could no longer whistle|Even McPherson and McGregor, though both were good-natured, expected Elliot to contribute to conversations and looked at him with puzzled patience when he did not.

Ian, on the other hand, just fished. And shut his mouth.

The two men hadn't said a word to each other since Elliot had found Ian examining the fishing rods in the back hall of McGregor Castle that morning. Elliot had said, "Do you fish|"I would have," Genevieve cried. "It would have taken me time, but I would have come home, Mama. I missed you and Papa so. I would not have been able to live long without you."

Her mother hugged her again and stroked her hair. "What is it that you want to do, Genevieve|He took the phone from my hand and set it on the bed while he handed me the next box. I smiled as I bit my bottom lip anxiously unwrapping, excited like a child on Christmas morning, the perfect silver square box. I removed the top and inside sat a stunning silver bracelet with the infinity symbol encased in diamonds. I gasped as I ran my finger along the diamonds|`She'll have to lawyer-up,' said Sergio. `That will keep her out of jail.  But she might be unemployable when we look for new jobs.'

`Give her some time,' said Maria. `Maybe she'll be fine tomorrow.'

`If she is not prepared to commit perjury, if she can't lie with credibility, so to speak, then we have to convince her to clam up,' said Sergio|The last thing she needed was to be inspected by Luca's friends and acquaintances and found wanting-especially compared to Isabella.

"Ah, that is a little thing." Isabella dismissed her concern with a wave of a hand. "We can go shopping for a dress ... and shoes," she said, glancing at Sophia's well-worn footwear. "You are working tomorrow, yes, Luca|She’s done nothing but stalk you. Who is she?”
“Cat?” He pulls out a chair, serious now. “I don’t know much about her. She was living with John in Leeds for a while. She said she came from Underground London Zone. She’s looking for someone—that’s why she was with John|I expected to see Mallory, but Gabriel entered with Connor still in his arms.

Berna's expression softened, showing that hint of the motherly worry that was driving Mallory crazy. "She is good?"

"She'll be fine. I sent her back to the kitchen. The meat guys asked if they could come early today. They want to talk to you about the brisket order|"Then some of the grape skins split and the illusion spell makes it look like there are eyes, all bloodshot and oozy."

Boyo, you may have just ruined your chances of ever seeing another grape in this house,Daemon thought.

"Did yousee the mouse in the glass?" Mikal asked. "That one was-"

A growl, the voice barely recognizable as female.

Mikal hunched his shoulders and wisely offered no opinion about the mousie in the glass|Kylie stood centered between Della and Miranda, and arm-locked to Miranda's side was Perry.

Miranda had spotted Nikki, the shape-shifter who was crushing on Perry, waving at him earlier, and the witch hadn't let go of Perry since.

Kylie had also spotted Miranda's pinky twitching. If Nikki knew what was good for her, she'd give up on Perry|"But it wasn't really my thing. So ... I joined the school paper." Martin reached his arm in and carefully placed a big glass of water on the table beside Ivy's chair.

"Some water?" Serena Star offered brightly, springing back to life.

"No, thank you," said Ivy|Potterley said, "I waited till five, till you were... May I come in?"

Foster nodded.

Potterley said, "I suppose I ought to apologize for my behavior. I was dreadfully disappointed; not quite master of myself. Still, it was inexcusable."

"I accept your apology," said Foster|I ordered eggs over easy, bacon, and American fries. Little Donny wanted the same. 
“I’m heading home tomorrow,” Little Donny said to George. “I thought I might help you finish the hole in Granny’s barn first.”
“Sure,” George said. “I’ll stop home and get my tools|Strangle them with his lace cuffs this time?

Lysander feigned a look of horror. "I am a member of the High Circle, my pretty." He showed her his hands. "Hold it."

She gasped when she did. "Baby soft!" She shook her head in amazement. "Even Daryl's aren't that soft|Can you handle Surreal?" Daemon asked.

"Don't need to be handled," Surreal muttered.

"Do you really want Lucivar to help you into the Coach?" Jaenelle whispered.

"No."

"Tersa?" Jaenelle said. "Give me a hand?"

With Tersa on one side and Jaenelle on the other, she didn't trip or stumble on the way to the Coach|“Get up, change into another dress, and follow me.”
I crossed my arms over my chest. When did she get so bossy?
“No,” I said simply.
I saw my nurse gawk. Perhaps, she had never seen anyone disobey their superior before.
“No?” Selenah echoed. “I will not tolerate such–”
“I said no, Selenah|`No offense taken!  And thanks for saying I'm pretty!  But maybe we shouldn't talk about that witch,' said Jennifer.

`We're better now.  It was good for us to have that cry, to get it out of our systems,' said Kayla.

`Sounds like you've had some nightmares,' said Jennifer|Tuki looked back down at the skyglass and blushed.
"Okay." Kim was nodding her head slowly and still looking at Tuki when he stole a glance a few seconds later. "86,400 seconds in a day. And 365 days in a year, Tuki?"
"31,536,000 seconds in a year."
"So, this light travelling at 300,000 kilometers per second will travel how many kilometers in a year, Tuki|We shared one of those nervous giggles that turns into full-on laughter, and by the time we got to the Union, I was wiping tears away.

"I swear, I'm not normally this weird," she said as we joined the lunchtime throng and descended into the food court. Only a second later she said, "Okay, that's a complete lie. I am normally this weird."

"I won't tell anyone," I whispered as we scoped out what was available|"If I don't call in by before seven thirty this morning, a search plane will be over looking for us."
"We want our girls," Peter hissed. "Call your dog off."
"Hush, Girl. Come here!" Reid whispered.
Cinders immediately stopped growling and ran to stand beside Reid|Mark laughed, but Zane felt like he wasn't quite getting the joke.

Mark helped Annie into the cab of Zane's truck. Zane hung back with Ty, holding his hand to keep him there. "I'm sorry about-"

"Zane, don't." Ty looked around the parking lot and then at Zane|I didn't hear the bike start up and my head hurts from getting slammed into the dashboard. Thanks for that too, by the way."

"Psh, whatever." Mel waves me off. "I'm helping you develop some character. All white girls need a little color here and there."

"Not in the form of bruises. Come on, where is he, Mel|"It didn't work yesterday; it certainly won't work now. I'm afraid absolutely nothing could possibly convince me to change my mind."

Bella felt tears of anger sting the back of her eyes, choking her throat. "Why are you doing this, Jason, when you can have any woman you want?"

"Ahh, but that's not true, is it Bella|"I want to kiss you, Rose," he said softly. "And I want you to want me too."

Every aspect of his body - his lips, his hands, his scent - suddenly overpowered me. I felt warm all over. I wanted him to kiss me with every ounce of my being. There was nothing in life I wanted more than that kiss|You know, when you took over the winery from your dad and made some dramatic changes to how things would be run?”
“The winery was sinking, Scott.  A few more years and it would have been bankrupt if I’d kept doing things the way Grandpa did.”
“And how are we doing now?”
“Well,” Walt licked his lips, looked over at Melissa and back to Scott|There is a bit of land around the meeting place of each clan that's traditionally held as that clan's exclusive domain, like those four square miles around Bouda House. It's mostly a courtesy so the clan could meet in private. There is no clan territory and no individual territory, so your house becomes your territory. When you're pursuing a female, you're trying to prove that you're clever enough to get in and out of her territory|I can either double back risking another block of being in the wide open, or maneuver through this fifteen foot deep crater. I spend a few seconds and think about the time difference of taking both directions. My goal is to get to the scream as quickly as possible. I decide to chance the path through the crater|It was busy and dusty and I was fascinated with the place.

A fierce Hispanic woman stopped typing after watching me for a moment. "You looking for somebody?" she asked. It was more of a challenge than a request. A receptionist at Drake and Sweeney would be fired on the spot for such a greeting.

She was Sofia Mendoza, according to a nameplate tacked to the side of her desk, and I would soon learn that she was more than a receptionist|They marched him to a building on the outskirts of the town where the guards opened the door and thrust him inside. The door thudded shut and Jina was left trying to adjust to the turn of events—from mess hall to imprisonment within five minutes—as well as to the gloom inside the building.
A voice asked warily, 'Is that you, Jina|She ripped free of his grasp and clawed at his ears, his nose, his cheeks, scratching and slapping. He continued to fight her off.

"Help!" he screamed to Alec.

"Push her off so I can get a clear shot!" the man yelled back.

Mark twisted his body and darted a quick glance at Alec|Qiaoshan turned to his son and addressed him with a smile. “I am feeling fine my son. Thank you for saving my life.” He said bowing to his son, “had you not been down in the caverns, I would have not made it. For that I am grateful.”
“Don’t thank me…” Jhahnahkan said turning to Helen, “you can thank your mother for her intuition to come to the caverns|But you just had to fall in love with that Castollan. You just had to ruin my plans again!”
So this was Rebecca’s grand plan. She wanted to get back at Azarmon and Pela. Anya knew that she had to act carefully, but did not know how else to buy more time. “Father was never in love with you, Rebecca|"Sophie, how long do you have before your flight?" asked Allison.
Sophie looked at her watch, it was 12:00. "My flight leaves at 3:00 this afternoon.  I'm leaving in about fifteen minutes.  I decided to call a car service. I didn't want to put you guys out.  It's been a long morning," said Sophie|Josh and I each snuggled up with the kids, and he read them a quick story. Will passed out as soon as Josh had begun reading the story. We tucked them in and kissed them good night. Libby had a new thing where we had to touch her hand three times before we could leave and shut the door.

After that, I slowly closed the door and looked up at Josh|I'll come get you in a few minutes after I'm done with this chair."

"Oookaaaaay," the little boy mutters, dropping his head as he goes back inside.

When the door shuts, Nicole grabs the phone. "How do I take it off speakerphone?"

Brian uses his stick to point it out to her.

"Gary, hi, this is Nicole|This time Georgia nodded.

" 'Can you tell me about it?' Dr. Wells asked.

"No response.

" 'Do you miss Daniel?'

"Here, she nods again. Then she says, 'It's all my fault.'

" 'What's your fault, Georgia|It was so startling, so immediate, that he withdrew guiltily, embarrassed to think that Dana must have felt it too. But she just lay there in the same relaxed position, smiled slowly, and murmured, ‘That was nice.’
Jina leaned over to repeat the experience but she put up a restraining hand, saying, ‘Enough for now, Jina.’
‘I want— ‘
Dana raised her hand again, closed her eyes, and murmured, ‘Take it slowly, Jina|“I don’t need any help, thanks anyway,” Redding said.
“Two minutes ago, you were asking about the culture. All of the sudden, you know everything? If you think it’s going to be easy, you’re wrong, but I can set it up.”
“I have a better idea,” Ting interrupted, before turning to Redding|“Harlin this…Demke,” the commander said.
“Copy, go ahead,” Harlin replied.
“We’ve...ad unreliable hits on Speciali…Orton’s trans…der from when it…last active. We’re…ending you the two coord…ates now.”
“Understood, standing by,” said Harlin|He rubbed his sore arms from the windsurfing.  He closed his eyes tightly and rubbed his arm muscles.
"Please, let's not get into this now.  This is our last night together.  I leave early in the morning, and I want it to be on a good note."
"Of course you want it to be perfect; you are the one that is leaving|He just couldn't believe his luck!

After Mr. Gault went over announcements, he nodded to Hardy. Reaching for his camera bag, Hardy turned quietly to Miracle. "Let's go. Time to get the tour."

Hardy nearly held out his hand for Miracle to take. Luckily, he realized it in the nick of time and stuffed that hand in his pocket instead|"I want you back."

Apparently he intended to wear down her defenses until he got what he wanted. It sounded as if he planned to wait outside the salon every day until she moved back to Yakima Street. For her, the problem with that was twofold. First, Jane didn't want him hanging around, and second, Rachel feared that in time he would wear her down to the point that she'd agree|A waiter came from the back of the pub and led us to a niche with a small table. Square. Quinn and my mother lowered at opposite sides. Julian went around the table, giving me a suggestive glance over the candle-lit top before he eased down. This left me to sit between my mother and Quinn|King Zeller's smile was scornful as his eyes lowered to stare at his own ring. "You know the answer to that as well as I do."

I shook my head, denial coursing through my veins, and covered my mouth with my hand as I turned my attention to Antonio. "Tell me this isn't right, Antonio|"Thought I heard someone say something about a rockslide less than a minute ago. But maybe I imagined that."

Aria arched an imperiously exasperated eyebrow at the barbarian.

Doroga smiled.

Aria sighed and shook her head, folding her arms a little closer to her chest. "You don't think much of us, do you, Doroga|Several other questions bubbled to the surface.
"Will you be directing the Russian operations?"
Lars took another sip and sat in the large leather chair behind his massive desk. He took a deep breath.
"I am not permitted to return to Mother Russia, comrade. And what makes you think your next operation will be in Russia|Whereas most of the nuns who taught me in St. John’s were very nice, Sister Camillus was a paleo-throwback to a previous world of school discipline. In other words, she was mean and unpleasant. She once humiliated me in front of the class for misspelling the word “paid” as “payed” in an essay. “Imagine a fifth grader who doesn’t know how to spell the word ‘paid|It was while we were at Tara. Nobody you know.” Wade saw Rhett’s face relax slightly, but a wild look still remained.
“You have to tell me who it is. That kind of bruise is the result of being lashed with a buggy whip. Who is it?” Rhett clenched his fists, knowing the brutality of man with a whip|'Anyhow, what you choose to do is your business, Serena. I was just letting you know Erin and I won't be home tonight. Okay?'

'You liked Nic?'

'Yes, I did.'

It didn't prove anything. Angelina Gifford's observation just seemed more pertinent-There wasn't a female alive who didn't love Nic|"This keyboard is a hologram, yet when I place my fingers inside, I can feel the keys. I'll type Nisha. Hmm, this might be a word association thing so I'll also type me, woman, and female. Oh, now I think it's prompting me to say the words. Okay, Nisha, me, woman, female|"Suspicious ... Wayne, I lost two shipments. I'm the one who got robbed! Why would that make me a suspect?"

"How am I to know how your devious, criminal genius mind works, mate?"

Footsteps sounded outside the room. Waxillium glanced at the door, then back at Wayne|Tonight I would give myself to Beau because I wanted to. He was the town's bad boy and I was the preacher's daughter. It wasn't supposed to happen this way.

"Ash, I want you. Bad, very, very bad. But you deserve better than this."

I bent back down over him and kissed him again before pulling back enough to whisper, "It doesn't get any better than this, Beau|When everything was done, he grabbed me by the shoulders and made me face him. "You are too important to me to be a rebound or a fling. Get that into your head, Sofia. I'm tired of being just your friend and I want to give us a real shot."

"Why now?"

"Because as I told you back at the truck, I feel like I'm losing you... I don't want that to happen, Sofia|He doubled over and received an elbow to the back.  The mugger was going for another elbow when he dodged the blow.  The mugger came down on air and his momentum caused him to crash to the floor.  Michael seized the advantage and landed two kicks to the mugger's kidneys.  The mugger squirmed in pain.  Michael withdrew his gun and pointed it at the mugger|His splitting headache and something else which he almost recognised. 
And now another. More sound, making itself heard over everything else. He recognised that, too. He was sure. A voice over everything else. And a message he recognised, too. He had heard it before. The noise, and the voice, and the message|"I thought you liked trees," Garion said.

"Not these." She looked about fearfully. "There's something very cruel about them. They hate each other."

"Hate? Trees?"

"They struggle and push each other, trying to reach the sunlight. I don't like this place, Garion|Written assurances that we'll be given access. Per your request of yesterday, we've reserved the right to the Federation on approval of any church construction."

She unfolded the papers and saw the text had even been prepared in Kazakh.

"We thought it easier to have it in your language."

"You thought it would be easier to disseminate in my language|Rain began to fall. For the first time, Andy and Alden were glad they had the thick canopy to keep most of the moisture away.
Hearty food coupled with a good night’s rest had renewed Andy’s hopes. He was in a good mood and started to whistle.
“Do you think it’s a good idea to whistle|She carried a surfboard and had a year-round tan."
"They had Barbies when you were little?"
"Prehistoric Barbie," Gracie said with a straight face. "Ken came with a loin cloth and a club."
"I have two Barbies and one Ken." Sophie lowered her voice and leaned closer to Gracie|I stank of wolf and I must have looked like a monster, and she was hugging me hard enough that I could feel it over the top of the pain. She was so brave that she made a tear escape.

"Does it hurt?" Rachel whispered, letting me go.

I shook my head fiercely. I balled my hands up against my body. "I just love you and it's making me ... making me ..."

"Turn into a wolf," said Rachel|As he did Mike began to struggle but the force of the others was too great for him and all he could do was scream. 
After he tied it down he backed away, watching his friend writhing in pain on his bed.

“That won’t last long. If we don’t get him to a hospital he’s not going to make it,” Riley said, still staring at Mike|Dr. Jordan opened the glass door for Billy and the Whitcombs to enter. But Carolyn stood frozen.
“What’s wrong, princess?” Dr. Jordan asked with a calm voice. Billy got the idea that this wasn’t his first experience with stage fright.
“I don’t like hospitals.”
“Me either … but this isn’t a hospital|I’ll be more careful in the future.”
“The future? No, I’m taking the information to the police and we’re out of it.”
“I thought you wanted to catch the guy.” Josh hisses urgently.
“Close, I want to make sure he gets caught. I don’t need to do the catching|And the locket."

Now she was paying attention. "What about the locket?"

"It's some kind of Dark talisman, whatever that means, and your uncle told Amma that I never buried it. They were really freaked out about it."

"How would they know it's a talisman|Claudio suspected the Padisha Emperor had a death-blow ready; and by the end of those two long hours his guess was confirmed.
The enemy army parted to make way for a thousand marching feet. These were the so-called 
Invincibles, dressed in heavy iron caps and long knee-length hauberks, and bearing spears and iron-rimmed wooden shields. On the flanks were magi in their white turbans and long purple robes, who at once conjured up orbs of flame and hurled them at the army|On the first quest, all the bats had gathered in a clump to sleep together after flights. But maybe Ares wasn't welcome now.

"Hey, Ares, do you know how long it will take us to get to the Labyrinth in this boat?" asked Gregor.

"At least five days," said Ares|Through the trees she could see a small clearing, half covered in snow. The horse came to a halt, and Lord Cornwell dismounted.
“Come, my lady, we have arrived.”
With Cornwell’s help, she dismounted as well, landing on the ground as well as she could.
“Where are we?” Larissa asked, as she walked with Lord Cornwell towards the clearing|I was just looking for my friends,” Brandon said, tears welled in his eyes.
“Look son, you best go home now. I’ll find your friends and get them home too. I didn’t mean to scare you, but I had to see if you knew the way into the building.”
“The only way I know is the way we went in before, but it’s locked,” said Brandon|He searched his memory, which was extensive, but couldn't find anything or anyone named Margreta. Sunny was so damned convincing... "Why would she think you're dead?" he demanded. "You might just be in a place that doesn't have a signal - like here. What is she, some kind of nutcase?"

"I make certain I'm always somewhere that has a signal|Viktor rose to his feet and Rose stood straight and confidently beside him.

"Thank you, Father," said Viktor.

"Now, it's almost dawn. I want you safely in the cellars."

"But why? Why must we be in the cellars now?" Viktor asked. He obviously didn't like the idea of being in a cellar|“It was a joke,” said Gabriel.
“Ah, yes,” said Flannery, not all that convinced.
Gabriel looked at Heather who didn’t find it funny either.
“Sanskrit has not been spoken on Earth for three thousand years,” said Heather.
“I said it was a joke,” said Gabriel|Jacob parked his truck next to my dad’s car in the Tropicana’s parking lot. Everyone agreed to meet in the parking lot at four o’clock for dinner. Again, Gina, my mom and I headed in our own direction away from the guys. We walked to some small casinos and gambled there. We were given a plain white glove at one of the casinos|And fourth, they fit perfect.” Brad pedaled on and the hem of his dress caught in his chain, twisting his foot off the pedal. He veered off the road and tipped over into the ditch, another one without water, but plenty of mud. He got up and wiped off the goo, then wiped his hands on the dress|Seth traced the dirt with the end of a stick. “You say I’m stubborn” I laughed and he continued, “Listen, I don’t even know if it’s true or not. There’s no need for me to worry any of you. That’s why I didn’t say anything.”
“I still don’t care, Seth|"Lystus might have taken me out of the ring, but I made him use a quite a bit of effort to put his neck right."
"Considering that you can use no external fuel sources, is it best if you can end a round quickly?" said Alcander.
"Depends on the tournament," said Lystus|Kathy had heard of cases when a man would contract an STD, and then give it to his unsuspecting wife.  Maybe she should go to the doctor, but just thinking of it made her laugh to herself.
“Yeah right; how would I explain that to Dr. Cho?  She’d think I had lost my mind,” Kathy chuckled at the image of her doctor’s face when she explained why she wanted to be tested|He jumps on his bike and tucking his head into his shoulders races towards us. He screeches to a stop dangerously close to Blake's feet.

'Oi! Watch it,' I warn.

'Sorry,' he apologizes with a cheeky grin.

'What's your name?'

'Kensington Parish.'

'Want to watch my car for me, Kensington|‘I saw him last week,’ guv, ‘Dressed as a gentleman, he was, but I recognised him at once. I’d know that crafty face anywhere, even after twenty years.’
‘So, you were comrades-in-arms, were you?’
‘We may have been in the same regiment,’ the newsagent puffed out his chest, ‘but we were not comrades|And meant it.
“Yes, you are,” said Charles. And tried to mean it.
:
This time Dr. Evans called his father, who in turn brought Charles into his office.
“Where’s Melissa?” said Dexter, covering the mouthpiece of the phone.
“I don’t know,” said Charles|The two girls looked around Addy, toward Matt and Gage as if they expected help.
Gage walked past Addy, brushing his fingers lightly along her arm. His touch mixed with the adrenaline pumping through her body felt like needles piercing her skin and she pulled her arm away.
“Leaving now would be a good idea,” he said to Tweedledee and Tweedledum when he was between them and Addy|And she would then be on her own on the other side of the Atlantic, and after what she heard from the group in the lounge earlier, she faced an uncertain arrival. Isabelle could help her understand what was going on. She didn’t think there was going to be a war.
Julia went out to the deck, followed by Isabelle|“Find the door with your symbol on it.”
“Uh,” Jason raised his hand sheepishly, “how do we know which symbol is ours?”
She smiled. “You will know.” She motioned for us to move up to the doors.
I walked slowly and leaned forward to see the symbol|She couldn’t say any more because she started to giggle.
‘Hey, what’s the joke?’
Between giggles, Dana said, ‘You are amusing.’
‘No, I’m not.’
‘Oh, Jina, don’t get so upset. You make me happy.’
Jina said, ‘I’ll tell you what, Dana|“Yes, there’s an overnight case on my back seat, can you grab it for me?” replied Katrina.  She handed him her valet key and stepped out of her vehicle.
Katrina searched for the young man’s name tag. "Excuse me Derrick, would you happen to know Mr. Peterson?” she asked.
“Yes, everyone knows Mr. Peterson, he’s a fixture at this hotel,” replied Derrick|But a lot had happened in the time they had been apart. She had spent a year moving on.

"I think you're just being stubborn," he finally said, breaking the silence.

Liz tilted her head forward and looked at him incredulously. "I'm being stubborn? You, of all people, are telling me that I'm stubborn|This time I couldn't stop at least some of my rage from leaking through and the white noise generator crackled and popped as some of the energy that escaped me bled over into the physical plane in some way that it never had before.
"It's possible that you're right, but right now I don't particularly appreciate you calling us all pawns."
Kaleb waved my concern away. "No offense was intended, and you know it. More importantly, you're not one of the pawns|"Well, they're gonna do that anyway if we don't try," said Holly. "So really, there isn't any harm. I say we go for it."
I knew Holly had been using her power, because Stephanie started to look convinced.
"Okay, all right," mumbled Stephanie|Then Ananda added, “And when you stop to think about it, miracles are as natural as anything, they obey laws, too, only that we are not yet privy to them.”
To Ananda’s mild astonishment—or perhaps not so mild—Melissa seemed to understand. No, there was no seemed about it, she did understand|When I finally stirred it was the middle of the afternoon.
I wandered over to Bogdon’s tent and Bog, Toby and Charlie were still hard at it.  Several external plates had been removed from the egg and there were components and pieces of hardware spread out across a bedroll.  They were hard at it and there was not enough room for another body in the tent|"I had hopes of a match between you and Rionna. It would seal an alliance and bind our clans."

Ewan lifted his brow but didn't say anything. He eyed McDonald to see where he was going with the current conversation.

McDonald looked over at Alaric and Caelen before returning his gaze to Ewan.

"I would speak plainly with you, Ewan|She called me to her one evening and asked me if I would take the vase and cherish it as she had done. I was surprised by this request as I looked upon the vast as a beautiful valuable object. She was very sure that this was what she wanted for her precious vase and had even put the gift to me in her will.
She took me by the hand and told me she wanted me to know the history of the vase|"Maybe you should listen to me more often."

Her eyes twinkled with amusement. "Last I checked, I've been listening to you plenty this vacation. My back's still hurting from listening to you in the shower, on the living room floor, and on that dang deck chair this morning."

"Then after dinner, you may listen to me in a bed|He smiled at her and said, "Can we go inside?"

"Yes. Sure." She stepped back and Colt slipped past her. He carried both babies into the living room, set them down with their toys, then came back to her. She couldn't look away from him. She was half afraid that if she did, he might disappear|“So, after a little chat with Aldrissk their leader, we now have a trade agreement with them in exchange for furs and peace.”
“Erm, don’t you forget a little of my old magic helped with the negotiations as well,” Lord Blot added.
“Yes,” agreed Jakob. “You’re going to have to teach me how you do that with your stick.”
Lord Leggid sat up straight and stared at Jakob|What about Michael? He's good with IT – he fits in anywhere."
"Gabi's still in Russia and Michael…he won't be involved in this one. It's too dangerous." Raphael didn't elaborate. His breathing crackled through the phone line.
"You're not selling me on this, Raphael|"I'm done," Jack informed Rachel, setting his phone down. "I said two hours, and I have a ten minute walk back. Owen can handle the rest."

Rachel picked up one last sheet of paper. "Just this one and you are free for the day, I promise."

Jack hastily scribbled his name and looked up at Rachel|A small old man was bent over behind the counter, and it was clear even from here that he and his striped button-down were the source of the sweat smell.

"Are you here for the trucks?" The man straightened up and peered at me through square glasses. Racks of packing tape hung from the Peg-Board behind his head. I tried to breathe through my mouth.

"Hi," I said. "I'm not here for the trucks|"Of course I do," Olivia said, smiling warmly at her mother's knitting friend. Charlotte and Laura were the people responsible for inspiring the thriving seniors' knitting group. The enthusiastic Laura was an accomplished knitter and Olivia had always suspected she could convince the whole world that peace was a possibility if everyone took up knitting needles instead of guns.

"I'm so pleased you could accept our invitation," Mary Berger, the center's social director, said as she approached Olivia|Given…”.
Keith moaned from his spot on the couch. “Just let me go already. You can’t keep me here like this. Elise, please, you’re such a good person. Let me go and we can work this out.”
Owen glared at him warningly, causing him to silence immediately, then turned back to Elise|Dusty reached for his bed-side locker. “I’ve got the bullet, if you’d like to see it.”
“No thanks,” said Stan. “Anyway, I’m sorry, and I’ve told everyone else who heard me loose off.”
“Say no more about it,” said Dusty|I can stand around all day and watch you guys dig in the dirt.”
“Sarah.”
“Uncle Marty.”
“Sarah. I’m warning you. I’ll turn this car around right now and take you back to the Duguays’.”
Hmph.
“Well, do we have to stay the whole time then|David followed Lizzy, her red sweater a startling flash of color against the browns and greens of the trees and the swampy water. The place smelled of decay, and David kept an eye trained to the path, making sure they weren't blundering into snake nests or worse. He kept telling himself that it was a cool day, and reptiles were cold-blooded.

Also, he wasn't about to tell Lizzy he was scared of snakes|One of about twenty contacts we have recruited since I left the Order. None of them know more than they need to know. Fredrik or I will give them an order and like any job, they fulfill it. Of course, working for us is far from being like any job, but you get the picture."

"They don't know the danger they're in being involved with you and Fredrik|“Look, I think the only way out of this is to head away from the mall. I don’t know what these things are or why they’re here, but for some reason they came here,” he said.

Jennifer wiped steadily forming tears from her eyes, trying to stay calm.

“What if there are more of them out there, away from the mall|Standing in front of Blake--and not leaving him enough room to dart past and get out the door--were Trudy and Merv.  "This is it, old man!" said Merv confidently.  "We've come the distance.  Get out there and knock 'em dead.  But just remember not to say anything stupid|"See the way the color in my ring changes when I touch you?"

Lexi licked her lips and nodded.

"There's more green and blue than any other color. Plus, you feel those little sparks of power arching between us, right?"

Again, she nodded, but she hadn't taken her eyes off the ring|She didn’t seem to mind as I gently ran my fingers down the row of metal, there were six of them, then came back halfway and rested my palm against them, a finger on each of the grooves of skin in between the tags. She lowered her arms down, and squeezed my hands into her sides, rotating her shoulders so that my hands rubbed her skin in a circle.
 	“Can you feel the difference?”
 	I was confused, but didn’t want to lose the moment. Her right side felt colder, but that was probably only because of the metal|Kelly watched as Diane stepped out onto the road and threw the cards down on the street. Within minutes, they had been run over by a dozen cars and trucks.

In the distance, the sounds of approaching sirens were filling the air.

Kelly stood up. "We'd better get away from here, Diane|The Elite rarely visit the Catacombs."

I did a one-eighty and found Corrine standing behind us.

Derek was more reluctant to face the beautiful witch. He slowly twisted around before glaring at Corrine.

"Hello to you too."

They dueled with glares before both directed their attention toward me.

"So you finally decided to visit the Catacombs|Vivian threw herself on top of me, and we rolled over and over across the stone, with her trying to tear the candle out of my grasp, and me tightening my death grip on the smooth piece of wax. I couldn't let her get her hands on the candle now. Not when I only had one laurel leaf left on my bracelet and no time to press it into the wax|With Tristran's next step he was standing beside a lake, and the candlelight shone brightly on the water; and then he was walking through the mountains, through lonely crags, where the candlelight was reflected in the eyes of the creatures of the high snows; and then he was walking through the clouds, which, while not entirely substantial, still supported his weight in comfort; and then, holding tightly to his candle, he was underground, and the candlelight glinted back at him from the wet cave walls; now he was in the mountains once more; and then he was on a road through wild forest, and he glimpsed a chariot being pulled by two goats, being driven by a woman in a red dress who looked, for the glimpse he got of her, the way Boadicea was drawn in his history books; and another step and he was in a leafy glen, and he could hear the chuckle of water as it splashed and sang its way into a small brook.

He took another step, but he was still in the glen|"He is," Ty said as he checked the magazine in his gun.

"Is he on the take?"

Ty looked up to glare at him. He didn't answer, instead heading for the stern of the boat to call out to Nick and help him secure the gangplank they would use to switch boats.

Zane was scowling as he watched Ty and the shadowed figure on the other boat|“I’m sure he’s okay – come back toward us and we’ll figure something out,” comforted Dad reassuringly, but he knew the drop off was hundreds of feet deep.  Unless the robot landed on a shelf or otherwise got hung up on the face of the cliff he knew there was no way he was going to be able to reach it.
“Stay here and wait for Mom,” he instructed Sharianna.  “I’m going to go down to find the robot|Ana emptied her bottle of beer and said to McKenzie, “Well, here’s your chance to buy me another drink. But I want a cocktail with vodka in it.”
McKenzie returned with a tall glass of golden beverage and set it down in front of Ana, who immediately took a sip of it via a straw.
“Long Island Iced Tea, extra-long,” said McKenzie|I guess I never thought I'd love someone more than I feared fire, but I was wrong."

"So, you love him?" asked Lexi. Her dark eyes dropped to the floor like she couldn't stand to look at Helen.

"I do. So much."

After a brief silence, Lexi said, "I'm happy for you, Helen|“They sense the heat coming from the nearest body and will quickly source it out, but in doing so, as they get nearer to the warmth, they start to move faster and faster.”  She looked over at the now stricken scientist.
The others were also transfixed by the scene, a mixture of disgust and scientific curiosity on their faces as their colleague melted from the centre out.
The nearest took a step away from their colleague|Lena was shaking her head, tears streaming down her face. "How can I trust you?" But even as she said it, the flames began to die down in the space between them.

Lena started to reach out her hand.

Their fingertips were inches apart.

I could see the burns on Sarafine's arm as she reached for Lena|They'll catch their loved parents in some of the things their loved parents did and they'll lose their enthusiasm for it all. But all this is trivial. With me, it's a matter of important principle."

Potterley said, "Hang your principle. Can't you understand men and women as well as principle|However, my train of thought immediately began to shift, and I felt disoriented, as if I was waking up from a dream. 
“See her with your mind,” Baby prompted.
OK, but what the heck did that mean? I tried to focus on what was around me, without looking, and heard Marge and the visitor talking about something meaningless.
“Block out all sound,” suggested Baby|Alexis glanced between me and Jared with an amused smile, like she could tell how he affected me. “Yes, you have to come.”
Kyle nudged me with his elbow. “C’mon. You can check out our studio while you’re there.”
Well… I supposed it wasn’t that late yet, and I had been dying to check out the band’s studio|It’s very exciting to see the passion come alive inside you, but I need to end our little conversation for now because you have work to do.  You need to get busy as there is much more to come.”
John stood, grasping the receiver with the dial tone sounding in his ear.
“So, he wants me to get busy|"I do," he stated simply.

Hearing it from his own lips made it so much more real to me.

"How much?" I asked, finishing the patched sub-roof.

He looked at me as he dragged over the pile of wood shingles. "Honestly?"

"Yeah," I said, reaching for a shingle|It was pink and shaped like the barrel of a bazooka. The long tube held her fencing sword.

Uncle Edward stared at her with his hands on his hips. "I still don't know why you had to bring that thing with you, young lady."

Kady shouldered her bag. "Because I'm shopping for a new sword|It was loud, full of laughter, of music, and conversations. Lots and lots of conversations. Overwhelmed, she shrank back a little and gripped Gabriel's hand.

The second thing she noticed was all the kids.

They were everywhere, and so were their toys as they played. As a child, Summer had never been allowed to have store-bought toys|Ben managed a few more
steps toward Jay. He stopped again and sat on the
bench just a few feet away from him. No words were
spoken; neither man knew what to say or how to say it.
They both remained wrapped in a blanket of silence. In a
sudden bid to return to the land of the living, Ben cleared
his throat and turned toward Jay|“Now let go of me. I’m leaving.”
“No you’re not!” Eddie swung Sarah back into the kitchen, knocking over the table. She fell among the glasses, plates and pasta to the floor.
“Help! Somebody help me!” Sarah screamed while throwing shards of broken glass and stoneware at Eddie|She made a fist as she followed Luminaria all the way to the back of the bar. “You, sit there,” Luminaria gestured towards a booth. It was suitably gloomy and dank. “I must investigate.” Luminaria darted away.
Though Anna wanted to follow, Luminaria had already wended through the patrons’ legs and out of sight.
With a nervous sigh, she sat down at the booth|There remained a crowd in the background watching the proceedings. But they also could find nothing remarkable about the strange shaman. Surely they had a right to expect something special. Why would the Jagged-Feather be the only one to boast about him? A young boy, on a dare, sneaked behind Chaiko and touched him. Dawn grabbed him as he tried to run away and brought him to Chaiko|It was hard to tell what was actual worry and what was just shivering in his chest from the cold evening air. 
Have a little faith in me, I said sadly.
Henri put his hands up to his chapped lips and rubbed them gently.
“Since this war began, you are the only thing I’ve had faith in. Sometimes I still wake up afraid that you’re not real|Casey put his finger to his mouth, which plainly indicated he didn’t want to talk about it right now. 
Monson cocked the eyebrow. OK, Magnum, P.I., I’ll play along. 
They walked in silence as they made their way across the gym, through a large pair of doors marked “Men.” 
“Where’s Artorius?” asked Monson. 
“Over yonder somewhere talking to some chickadees,” said Casey|And then he told Mantra…


Mantra was not the type of person easily swayed by circumstances … but this was a circumstance that made a clear exception.   

“It can’t be…” he whispered, feeling stunned by what he had just heard. What Galinor had just told him. 

Galinor gave a sharp nod. “It is … and we need to attend to it now, Mantra|All the residents at the nursing home acted desperate and starved for attention.  I didn't have empathy over their loneliness; I could barely conjure up the means to deal with my own sorrow.  I felt terribly uncomfortable there.  I was afraid to look at anyone, fearing they would expect me to carry their burdens.
I tried to pretend that I didn't see any of the residents|We saw him discreetly putting everything in his backseat into the trash bag. He then drove over to the dumpster by the dorms and threw the trash bag in there.
We watched as our stalker started his car and followed Ryan out of the parking lot and out onto the main road. We waited a couple of minutes to be sure and ran out to the car and drove to the dumpster|"Aye, if comes to, he must drink several bottles."

She nodded. She'd wanted to take him to a hospital in Tokyo, but Angus had forbidden it. Couldn't risk Gregori falling into his death-sleep there, or being put into a room with sunlight.

With a groan, she hefted herself to her feet and sat on the bed next to Gregori|He gave a little hike of his eyebrow, which she took to mean that he'd heard the truth but had reservations about accepting that as the entire truth.

What might have happened to volatile Alterants in a place like the Maze of Death? She didn't like the idea of being trapped with spirits from a hundred and fifty years ago, whom Grady had intimated were not necessarily friendly. "You left them in that maze for the past week with all those spirits|“You’ve been asleep for more than four hours,” said Roman.
“How generous,” I said.
“What?  You want to sleep all day?”
I crawled out of the bed and slipped into some clothes that had been prepared for me.
“New?” I asked, indicating the clothing.
“Can’t have you walking around in 2016 wearing decade-old fashions,” said Roman|It was a shock to her system, and she felt her body recoil in disgust. After a minute, she had had enough and shut it off. At least the mud from the past few days was gone, though it had been replaced by a filmy, slimy sensation, and she couldn’t say it was such a great trade off.
As she stepped out, though, she realized she didn’t have a towel|Jane had lost her mother long ago, as well as the aunt who'd raised her. She'd never known her father. And that was before she married Oliver Burke.

As soon as Jane finished the haircut she'd been working on, Danielle pulled her aside. "You need to calm down or you're going to end up hurting yourself with your own scissors|There came a sudden feeling of exultation in Peyna's heart: he felt as one might feel in a dark cave when a light suddenly shines out.

"Give me the letter," he said.

Arlen did. He then made as if to scuttle out, and this was also something new, because Arlen did not scuttle. At least, Peyna thought, his mind lawyerly as always, I have never KNOWN him to scuttle|It wanted what my head wasn't sure it was ready for, but what my heart was screaming it needed.

I reluctantly broke away from Kane's lips. He first looked at me as though he wasn't sure if he had done something wrong. I mustered all the courage I could and whispered. "I want it to be you, Kane|As she took in the bubbling fountain in the center of the glass-enclosed area, the lush green plants and shrubs ringing the marble-tiled floor and impressive stone terrace, she didn't think she'd seen anything more beautiful. "This is breathtaking, Zach."

"Originally, it was my intention to make it a sitting area for guests of the resort." He took her elbow to steady her as they descended the terrace steps and walked over to the fountain|The last thing she remembered was Mark jumping back towards the cliff. After that was blackness. A big wave submerged her and Emma fought to pull her head above water again. Her clothes and shoes were heavy with water, they were dragging her down towards the bottom of the river. She could feel herself being rushed along with the current|He didn't look right walking down the street.  It was like his upper body didn’t match his lower body.” said Katrina.
“Could you see his face or hands, anything to identify what race he was?”
“No, I was too busy trying not to be seen by him. When he came out of the building I jumped back and thanked my lucky stars he went in the opposite direction,” said Katrina|“Well, so am I.”
“And how is Ruth?” he asked.
“She is perfection,” said Melissa, and Ananda could picture her smile.
“I’m sure she is,” he said.
“Are you coming down?”
“Perhaps in a few weeks,” he said.
“You have to meet,” said Melissa|“What happened?” asked the woman as she regained consciousness.
“My gun jammed,” said Duke.
“It did?”
“Oh, wait, no,” said Duke.  “It misfired.  I turned him to jam.”
“Jam?”
“I’m sticking with the toast metaphor thing for a while,” said Duke|I hear the tears in his voice even if he isn’t actually crying. “You don’t have to hurt anyone.”
“Zeke, you best mind me.”
I drop the axe to the ground at the same moment the gun goes off. The bullet rips into my bad leg.
I fall to the ground, on top of the axe|After the laughter died down, Beth sat the table for the five of them and fixed glasses of lemonade for all.
No one talked at all until they were half way through eating, then Tyler told Joy, “This is so good.  I don’t think I’ve eaten anything this good in a long time.  What about you Michael?”  Tyler wasn’t blind to the attraction between his friend and Joy|No sense in starting something now. I entered the courtroom, which was almost empty except for a few people sitting in the front row watching two attorneys argue a point in front of the Judge. The defendant was an inmate, dressed in an orange jump suit. He stood off to the side of his attorney|He wore a gray suit and a cap with Executive Limos embroidered in black above the shiny bill. The small, lethal-looking black gun, pointed directly at her, was rock steady in his hand.

In the corner to his right was Winifred, her hands secured with plastic handcuffs in front of her, silver duct tape over her mouth.

"Gran!" Chloe jerked, taking a quick instinctive step toward her grandmother|Later, when everyone was sipping tea and talking quietly, he got up his nerve. He wasn’t quite as smooth as he thought, because everyone in the room noticed it. Meaningful looks passed around. Eliza, blushing, held his hand.
Sarah and Hixson lay in their bed that night, talking quietly. Hixson was speculating on Caleb’s interest in Eliza|The renegade gave no sign of anger at his contemptuous tone; in fact, she didn’t even turn to look at him, preferring instead to act as though he did not exist. This was probably wise of her, Tir decided. Leron was twice her size. He would crush her like a twig.
Leron stalked away, leaving Xelind and Tir alone with the renegade|We were married at the courthouse four days later, after our license was approved. Sarah and Dave were our witnesses, and we celebrated afterwards with our normal card night.

Bobby knew it would be too much stress on me to move in with him right away, so he opted to stay the night with me. I still couldn't believe that I was married|The warriors sat at the other end of Dagdron’s table, talking and eating raucously, while the enchanters were more prone to talking about intellectual subjects. At the rogues’ end, everyone was silent except for Earl, who talked excitedly the entire meal.
“It’s tour time,” Earl announced when they finished breakfast.
As all the new adventurers returned to the entrance hall, Dagdron noticed that all the rogues kept away from him and Earl|I didn't want to win a popularity contest over Addison. I didn't care at all. Did I?

But because I didn't give Max a firm negative, he looked at me probingly for another long moment. Then he asked, "What are your duties as head majorette?" Funny, he phrased it as if I were actually going to get this position|“Sometimes we’d play a game that if they would find where on my body I would hide the candy they could keep it.”
“Then if they found it, they would pick it off you?”
“Yeah, sort of. But remember they wanted to play.”
“I understand. I’m just trying to get your side of it. How would they let you know they wanted the money and candy|“I wish I could stay here longer, hear some more of your music.”
“Stick around,” said Joe. “We’ve got lots of songs in America.  Just turn on a radio.”  
“Radio?” Mozart had never heard the word before.  
“It brings music to you right through the air,” said Joe|"I didn't do anything," the older man said.

"Unemployed? Me too. Pretty much like everybody else my age in Spain. But, you know I had just gotten some work as a substitute teacher-"

"I was in prison."

The young man paused, then asked, "What for|Wixelor woke with a start, the raven’s call still ringing in his ears.
	And then, turning around, he saw that it wasn’t all a dream: for through the dim light he saw the actual bird, sharp-beaked and black, sitting at the mouth of the grotto.
	There couldn’t be more definite an omen.

	He awakened the others gently by wrapping his long bony arms around them, and once they began to stir he wordlessly told them of his dream and how, since it had come so startingly true, it could only mean that they should try and follow the raven|Kiro started raising his voice, and I knew Grant needed me to rescue him. My dad was in a foul mood. I had to remember he was just scared. He'd already lost so much in life.

The room fell silent when I opened the door, and both men turned to look at me. I gave Grant a reassuring smile before turning my attention to Kiro|After talking with the hospital administration, Derek discovered Amber had walked out on her shift at the hospital about the same time the gas station attendant was brought in with severe burns.  She was never seen in Cleveland again after that night.
Derek had human resources make a copy of Amber’s application for him to look over.  After reading her references, he made inquiries at the other hospitals she had worked.  It seemed she had left a notice at the first hospital she worked at and the one in Middleburg, Florida, but had left just as suddenly from the Birmingham hospital as she had left Cleveland|I noticed a lot of other people here were doing the same thing. I looked at Hugo and I realized that I don’t even know about it. There was some sort of bond between him and other people in this place. 
A waitress walked up to us. 
“Two coffees, please,” said Hugo|Trey's lifestyle was certainly different from mine. He was devoted to his sport and always had bruises on him from practice, even now. They were more severe than usual. I couldn't understand his passions any more than he could understand my love of knowledge.

My phone buzzed again.

"Better get back to your fan club," said Trey|The little bed is neatly made up with a faded Star Wars comforter. Books and toys line the shelves. I drop the box down on the bed and pick up a sealed package containing an action figure of Han Solo. There is a thick layer of dust coating the top. I wonder if Bobby’s son was a serious collector|He made no apology for contradicting Marius now. They had been together for a long time. "And I'm not surprised to hear this. Every single one of you that I've ever known has had this capacity, to appreciate beauty and to love."

"Well, you're proving my point exactly," said Marius|And she can do it too—her army…this army…” He shuddered, ducking his head as if someone had swiped at him.
“I don’t get it. Why can’t you just make the cure without him?”
“Of course you wouldn’t get it. Without Ashton, we can’t make the cure|Cherry said, "Not counting all the crumbs and pieces left inside the suit."
"Drop it.  We need to see if we can communicate.  I want off this rock."
"So do I.  I'll get the translators.  We'll see if they work any better with spoken words."
In a few minutes, he came back with all the translators|Has Mike 

URSULA

No one's come in from that end of town since eight o'clock, but Mike's okay.

She sees MOLLY isn't convinced, and smiles a little bitterly.

URSULA

Nothing psychic about that part of it I've picked up a couple of broken transmissions on the radio. Once it was Hatch; once I'm pretty sure it was Mike|This encounter had been brewing since she'd first set eyes on him in the hotel foyer.

No, she admitted grudgingly. Since the first night she'd gone toe-to-toe with him in Vincent's hospital room.

She'd informed him visiting hours were over and he'd have to leave. He'd said, "Not unless you carry me out. My buddy needs me and I'm staying|A rocking chair swayed gently in a southerly breeze that blew in over the mountains, the air carrying a hint of jasmine and pine.

She had always loved this time of day, when all was quiet and her mind had a chance to slow down and reflect.

But for two days she had not been able to find that peace|"I came here to tell you ..." The words caught in her throat.

Dominic took her hands, and his touch was so strong, so warm. "Go ahead," he said softly. "I'm listening."

She looked up into his eyes, praying her words would come out right. "I've been in love with you for a long time, Dominic|Rachel was proud of herself for staying calm, speaking like a sane adult, and not slapping him again. How had she been so attracted to this jerk two months earlier? He radiated command as if it were a part of his skin, and she couldn't stand men who thought they were lord and ruler of everything around them.

"I don't think you understand, Rachel|You can cook.”
He grinned and gave a bow. “I try.”
Sykes chuckled. “Try? Please. You should come to our place for dinner sometime.” He picked up a plate and a fork then went back to the couch. “If he weren’t so good at manipulating solids, he’d be a chef|I'd had no real intention of cutting the sad little man, but if he kept spitting on me I might change my mind.

"Start talking, then." I carried him over to a chair and tossed him down in the seat. He groaned and rubbed his backside.

"Ouch! No need to be violent."

I got in his face. "On the contrary, there is every need to get violent|"Just yesterday I told Michael something I hadn't told one other person my whole life. And you know what?" She didn't wait for Becky to answer. "It felt good."

"What if your secrets affect other people?"

Karen held her dripping ice cream away from both of them and gave up trying to eat it.

"Well, I guess it depends on the secret|“Let me see that…” Sarah took the brochure from Abby and continued to read the inside and outside flap.  “This looks terrific…”
“Yeah, you’d be riding, roping and sleeping out under the stars.  All those things you’ve wanted to do.  Maybe you’ll meet a cute cowboy…”
Sarah swatted her with the brochure.  “That’s the last thing I want to do, Abby|Just as I turned the knob, Dad said, "Sophia."

"Yeah?"

When I looked back at him, he said. "I'm very proud of you for what you did. I have no idea what the far-reaching consequences of your actions may be, but-"

I held up my hand. "Let's leave it at the proud part for now, okay, Dad|On the north side was the hippodrome, and beyond it the towering White Palace with its colonnades, domes and immense columns. At once he made his way there.


The guards recognized Claudio and let him into the palace, explaining that he made it just in time for the celebration, that it had been moved back a day and would start tonight at sundown. Hearing this Claudio immediately went to his private quarters—a small marble-floored room on the seventh (and highest) story of the palace|Late Friday afternoon I loaded the van: picks, shovels, compressor, a hand-dolly, a toolbox, binoculars, and a borrowed Highway Department Jackhammer with an assortment of arrowhead-shaped attachments made for slicing through asphalt. A large square piece of sand-colored canvas, plus a long roll of canvas this latter had been a special project of mine last summer and twenty-one thin wooden struts, each five feet long. Last but not least, a big industrial stapler.

On the edge of the desert I stopped at a shopping center and stole a pair of license plates and put them on my van|He pushed himself up and they all stood together one last time.
“Take one water skin each. You can refill it out of the river so you don’t need to carry anything else but food.”
“What about the tent?” Connor asked.
“The next time you close your eyes you won’t need a tent|Do you have any questions for me?”
“How much does it pay?”
Angelique laughed heartily, a deep sultry laugh, causing Selena to blush with embarrassment. “My secretary should have told you that on the phone, dear. It pays four hundred per hour.”
Selena’s mouth fell open as she stared at Angelique|“They wouldn’t have Red in handcuffs.”
“Why not? The cops whisked him away from the house.”
“That was probably just for questioning or something like that.”
“Earth to Johnny B: How do you know that? How do you know that?” 
“Because I know Red’s not a criminal|"Ye hide a nasty sense of humor behind that innocent face," Sorely snarled, but he left her quickly, which had been her aim.

Ilysa had come hoping to find solace in Connor's chamber. The moment she crossed the threshold, however, she felt engulfed in sadness. Had she inadvertently summoned the despair of the two women, or did it have to do with Connor|In fact, Dara is larger than Mars but made of a material which is much less dense. Regardless, because of its mass, its gravity is nearly 30% of the Earth which is substantial enough to keep hold of an atmosphere. The atmosphere is completely unbreathable, made up mostly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen. 

Despite all the astrogeophysics, there was a much more mundane reason for postulating the size of Dara|Selena searched her friend’s face as they talked, but Beth seemed to be genuinely happy for her.
Selena’s parents, when she told them, were ecstatic about the movie, and when she mentioned the amount of money, her mother cried a little. “You can use it for college,” she sniffed, wiping her eyes. “I’m so proud of you, Selena|“I am not my sister,” she replied.
“Very well,” and he went out.
When he returned Connor and Kaitlin were back and Dylan felt weird about it, was it jealousy? Why was she looking after his Dad? She wasn’t his Mum. And he thought back to the Deer Woman, how he wished that had been his Mum|Dizzy walked a few circles around the statue, checking it out carefully. He put his head right up next to the Indian’s shoulders. 
	“Maybe his eyes are pointing the way?” Dizzy suggested, pointing in the direction the statue was looking.
	It was looking directly at Tom Sawyer’s Island.
	“We might be too late,” Travis said, pointing at the island|Surely our twin connection would make the process smooth and quick. He was able to get his magic back from me. I would be able to do the same. And I would return in the morning to offer my magic again for the safety of my people. Only this time, I would be offering more than my magic|I knew something was going to have to change. It was the longest three minutes of my life.

It came back negative.

I failed every class that semester. I lost my scholarship. I lost everything I had worked for. I had lost myself. I had no idea who I was anymore. What would have happened if it had been positive|Alex pulled back and allowed Colt to run into Ellie's arms.

"Mama, I missed you so much. No one makes pancakes or bacon like you do. Poor Grams just couldn't make the bacon the same, Mama. Thank goodness you're home!"

We all started laughing as Ellie stood and picked up Colt|He knew that he would get sympathy from her, who had no love for Attalus and his niece. He told her of the affair and of Philip's reluctance to redress his wrongs.
"That was a shameful thing that Attalus allowed to happen to you." Here was another possible ally for her to use against Attalus and his niece|There were no signs of Darkness, nothing in his behavior or conduct that would have given the High Council any reason to suspect him. He fought with the best. He and Ethan were very good together in the field, and when Ethan was stationed on planet, Aliah requested a closer position so that they could still work together. When or how Aliah defected is unclear, as are his intentions with Sitara and Ethan|At that very moment, while Miranda's heart was still between beats, Valentine strode into the hall. She had no time to be glad as their glances met and she knew he had felt her distress and come despite his own heartache.
"You've arrived just in time." Simon spoke brusquely as he looked at the note, looked at Miranda, looked at Valentine|Not after what Ripred had said. Then it occurred to him that he was not alone; he was only half of a team, and it might be important for Ares to know Ripred's thoughts as well.

"Hey, Ares, can you keep a secret?" said Gregor.

"I would say it is one of my few talents," said Ares|I scrunched my face when she read the title out loud.

"What's this?" she asked, then started flipping through the book. "Wow, they're really teaching you everything in high school these days. I could have used this when I went to school."

Before I could consider the results, I blurted, "It's not for school|Dumping it on the Foreman grill, he poked the br**sts around with a fork until they were placed perfectly in the middle.

He closed the lid. Juices sizzled.

And then he glanced over the counter at his phone.

He turned back to the counter and tossed the fork onto the countertop. Rocking back on his heels, he stared at the grill|His wife, a nurse, was working extra shifts to deal with the backlog of patients at her hospital. Since neither of them had any free time to look for temporary housing they were still sleeping at the football stadium.
After the adjuster had left Sam called Agostino to find out if the arrest warrant was ready. Agostino was in his office at the police substation near the Ranch; he confirmed that he had the warrant|The domed tents were being brought in from Srax camp and vehicles as well as personnel to staff those tents.
Abreon, “I wish Jake was here with us.”
Loss came over and sat down in the dirt with them, “I have strange news.”
Nece bitter, “Yes?”
Loss repeating himself, “I have news|Neither one of them were in any shape to drive. "I'll call a cab to drive me home and we can drop you off along the way."

She hoped her friend had better luck during her upcoming conversation with Richard than she'd had with Derek.

THE EFFECTS OF THE WINE had started to wear off in the cab|A short while later, Bob came across an entry, entitled The Beautiful Game, in an encyclopaedia. It was dedicated to the World Cup exploits of the Brazilian national football team, and logged full details of all their final appearances and victories, including day, month, year, stadium, city, country, and final score.
“Let’s see if they match,” said Bob|That way he could place both legs in a straight line. He cut off the head to finish the job."
The image burned into my brain. Norton continued with his description, his voice tightly controlled, his eyes never leaving mine.
"The N was harder. Again, he used the body as the angled bar in the centre of the letter|The Children of Mutanity, using floating rail carts obtained in Venecici, had ridden the Engie tracks all the way to the Fringes, only to find that the last human and her friends hadn't gotten off at the end of the line. They’d jumped off somewhere.
It hadn't taken long to pick up the trail though|She stopped when she noticed the way he was staring at her. "Is something wrong?"

Alek's eyes left hers and he shook his head. "Never mind."

"No, tell me, please."

He hesitated and Julia felt a jolt of fear. She'd read about this, in the very book that rested on the table between her and Alek|I laughed when I read that letter – sure supports the argument that the war was about slavery. Maybe it was about other things too, but there’s no doubt it was about slavery.” Reg turned to Darin. “What was that General’s name?”
“Cobb, I think,” answered Darin|"The shiners?" said Gregor.

"Vikus did not tell you?" began Mareth.

Gregor wondered how many times he was going to hear that in the next few days.

"On long voyages, we cannot carry enough fuel to provide light. So we hire shiners to aid us," said Mareth|He was either very trusting, or incredibly foolish.

"The first is that you didn't try to deny it when I confronted you," he said.

Rachel almost snorted. "Maybe I wanted to pawn my child off on a king. Clever, no?"

"But you didn't know I was a king|* * *

The day started badly and had gotten worse. The congee that morning had been burnt. It was so unlike Mei to ruin a meal. Congee should have had a light and delicate flavor, but it had been scorched in the pan. The taste was distinctly bitter and harsh. It wasn’t clear if Mei even knew that the congee had been burnt|It had been a big step for him to spend time with Cherise (and coincidentally with me) on the roof of the hospital; he'd made up for it by ignoring me the rest of the day. I'd returned the favor.

Kevin was here because he was a seriously talented young man. Not trained, not restrained, but ... talented|Bethanny had been watching him, a curious expression on her face. Her curious gaze shifted from him, to Carlotta, then back, her expression full of questions.
Charles cleared his throat, uncomfortable with the young lady’s awareness. “Bethanny, will you please see to your sisters while I speak with your governess?” He asked, hoping to eliminate any conclusions the girl might draw between himself and the governess|"Got bit by a turtle, if you really want to know. " I could see I was gaining his trust, so I went in with what is called a leading question.

"Frogs can give you a nasty bite too, can't they?" I said, very sympathetically. "Are you sure it wasn't a frog|For a moment, Jaimie leaned into him, but as if catching herself, she pulled herself straight, almost rigid, and stepped away from him. Mack looked down at his hands for a moment, working at keeping his mind and body under control. Abruptly, he changed tactics.

"I want you to do a little experiment for me, Jaimie|He cannot fight because there's no longer an army. He cannot resist because his infrastructure has collapsed. He cannot remain in power because what is left of his people will turn on him. The only option is unconditional surrender."

"Or pleas for a vaccine," Jaunich observed.

"A plea that will fall on deaf ears, since there is no vaccine|‘Yes said Louie, maybe there is. First of all I suggest that you go and remerge with the woman and then walk to the hospice’.
Louie thought some more then said. ‘I will follow and think about it while you walk there. I have got a plan’.
Lulu merged with the woman and started walking to the hospice|Howard grabbed the last two catch cloths and went to Twitchtip. He used one to bandage the stump of her tail. "I am sorry I had to sever it," he said to the rat. "There was no other way to free you."

"I would've bit through it myself if I could have," said Twitchtip|"I'm sure you know this layout," said Vlod. "It's the model railroad Gordon Varney commissioned, ages ago, to display his line of model railroad equipment. It was in Macy's shop window."
"Oh, EVERYONE knows THAT model railroad," said Macklin. "But I don't see--"
"I want you to build it precisely as it is depicted here," said Vlod|"Are you hungry?" he asked, lounging back in his seat.

"How long until we arrive to wherever we are going? Or was it truly a ploy to get me into this carriage?"

He smiled with great insouciance. "It was indeed a ploy. I wanted desperately to get you into this carriage|"At the ranch we've got Rob, Jamie and Ethan," Morgan countered. "We can call Rob's brothers, too, and the hired hands. We can have an army over there to protect her."

"She should be in town," Claire said. "That's much safer than on one of the ranches|Avati looked at Isis, who didn’t answer my question.
“What was his name?”
“Jaime.” Well that felt like a hockey puck to the face. My eyes filled with reluctant tears. 
“Oh no. Here.” Avati handed me a rose colored tissue.
“Thank you,” I said, taking it to my eyes quickly|The conversation stalled completely until Miriam said, "You know, honey, I'm thinking that you need to find someone who understands you. Someone you can talk honestly with."

Lark looked up from her breakfast right into the glittering eyes of Miriam Randall. "What do you mean? Like a therapist?"

"Why, do you need a therapist|"My grandfather must have brought me here when I was very young. I don't know. It feels familiar." As her eyes scanned the room, she began nodding with more certainty. "Yes." She pointed to the front of the sanctuary. "Those two pillars... I've seen them."

Langdon looked at the pair of intricately sculpted columns at the far end of the sanctuary|"I'd hide behind the thick curtains and watch everyone dancing and laughing, wishing I was old enough to come down."

"How old were you?" he asked.

"Oh, I guess I was about ten or eleven when I was finally able to even stay awake late enough to watch. One time, my mother found me asleep in the curtains|"Ivy, I am taking this job for you," he said gently. "You will understand one day, when you are a parent."

Without saying anything more, her father started to walk away. He turned to look back at her solemnly before climbing the stairs. "We'll be moving during your winter break. I know how hard this will be for you, Ivy|"The only unusual thing about Elizabeth is how kind she is. She's the most understanding person in this entire town."

"That's so true," Verlaine agreed. "Everybody loves Elizabeth."

He hadn't even realized they knew each other. Pretty much nobody paid attention to Verlaine, but if anybody would, it would be Elizabeth|But Tom didn’t care that he had been seen, such was his amazement and he just remained there, staring down, heedless of any danger he might be in, heedless of the storm that tore at him upon that exposed height, his eyes piercing the rain, transfixed on the boy.
It was Jack, he was certain of it.
The clothes were different from those his friend had worn when they were last together, but everything else, his posture, his whole attitude, said that it could only be Jack|If there'd been any chance of reaching some understanding with Nic, it was long gone now.

'I'm sorry,' she said on a wave of sheer misery. Then in a last-ditch defence, she added, 'Do you think I enjoyed stripping my soul bare for you tonight? Did it sound like a power game to you, Nic|I'm afraid it's not Athens, but I hope you will help me make it more so."
"Thank you, Sire." He turned to Phidias. "I would like to introduce to you, Master Phidias, who will assist me in tutoring your sons and those of your nobles."
"Welcome, Master Phidias. If Aristotle vouches for you, then you must have intelligence and a gift for teaching|“We got chewed out by a cop today. He said we were too annoying, basically.”
“Good, keep annoying him,” said Zoe with a laugh.
“What’s this?” said Ana when she came into the kitchen and saw the groceries.
“I’m just making sure my brother doesn’t starve to death,” said Zoe|They moved slowly, taking their time to get it properly centered. Hansum sat at the lathe nervously.
"I've not worked on a machine exactly like this before, Master. The one I worked on had a foot treadle."
"How strange," the Master said. Then he took off his leather cap and gave it to Hansum|“Come on, we better get going,” Jimmy said. “Or else there might not be any more space left in the circle.”
Larissa nodded solemnly, even as she said, “We’ve never not been able to get in the circle before.”
Jimmy agreed. Every year he, and the rest of his family, had always managed to get in the circle|Groups of surfers took their boards and headed for warm homes somewhere and one by one the old men and women who fished for sardines from the pier packed up their boxes and bags and buckets and left until only the pelicans and gulls remained to keep the child company.
He thought to shelter himself from the wind and rain on a bench inset along a wall of a small locked building on the pier|Reynaud looked up and down the street in case the lad was a diversion. "Who did?"

"A toff, same as you." The boy held out a sealed letter.

Reynaud fished in his pocket and tossed the boy a shilling. The lad scampered off without another word. Reynaud held the letter up. The light was too dim to see much, but he did notice there was no inscription on the outside of the letter|But in his vehemence, Yern had made the mistake of raising his voice. And now here came Yonfi, the padding of his tiny feet making the wooden floor shake more than his slightness warranted, his face aglow with merriment. 
	“Monsters, Papa? I wanna see monsters! Oh, can we please go see the monsters|Vicky began to flop over toward Jane, turning as she went. Vicky groaned and flailed one of her arms as she flopped. To Jane, Vicky looked like a diseased rag doll rolling its way across the living room floor.
The glass shards crunched as Vicky rolled over them. Then her arms were outstretched, reaching for Jane|In the not-to-far distance, the sound of rock music could be heard. 
“Sounds like it's already going good.” Doug smiled and slapped Cliff on the shoulder.
The party was just up the end of the block and around the corner. Doug stopped.
“Let's cut through here. We can get there quicker this way,” suggested Doug|He stared at the monkey, eyes wide, lips trembling.

Jang-jang-jang-jang--

Its body rocked and humped on the shelf. Its lips spread and closed, spread and closed, hideously gleeful, revealing huge and carnivorous teeth.

"Stop," Hal whispered.

His brother turned over and uttered a loud, single snore. All else was silent ... except for the monkey|And a lingering one..."I-What I meant was, are you a singer? Do you love to sing?"

The questions were logical. Their answers, she'd have imagined, straightforward.

But Nick frowned.

"I can sing," he said at last. "And there was a time, when I was a boy, that I loved singing|"You do realize you work, right?" he asks, looking at me in a sidelong manner. "Last week we raked in four hundred bucks the night we played at Levy's. Four hundred in one night ain't too shabby."

"I know," I say. "It just doesn't feel like a job|Kane laced his fingers with mine before bringing our joined hands to his mouth to kiss each of my knuckles. "I became addicted to you a long time ago."

We ended up staying in bed for a good part of morning. We talked about his plans for the bar he wanted to open, and how he couldn't wait to run his own place. His excitement about his plans were contagious and I couldn't help but picture Kane in his own bar|Two large omelets, three slices of buttered toast, an apple, and two glasses of orange juice later Emma finally got up and took her plate to the sink. She turned around to find Kathryn, Steve, and Morgan staring at her. 
“What?” She asked, self-consciously folding her arms across her stomach, which still wasn’t full|"You are perfect in every way, Lia. There is nothing I don't adore about you," he said, his eyes becoming glazed with passion as he leaned down and gently kissed her.

"Even my stubbornness?" she questioned.

"Especially your stubbornness. I wouldn't change a thing about you, Lia|Their heads looked just like horses, and they peered at the boys through large brown eyes with long flowing lashes.
“Do you want to pet one?”
“Yeah!” gawked Andy, his eyes growing wide. He reached out his hand to touch one.
“Don’t pet these pegasi. They’re trained for combat and they’ll bite|“Mattie never seemed like your type,” Chance said quietly, not wanting to open their conversation to others. He knew he was taking a big risk. Casey might just tell him to shove it, or she might just appreciate the support. He was counting on the latter.
She stopped in front of him, wiped the bar, and said, “Thanks, Chance|"I'll hurry back," he said and started to pull her into his arms.

Siri stepped back, not willing to let him touch her when she knew something wasn't right. "I'll see you when you get back," she replied, crossing her arms over her chest and looking away.

"You don't have to worry about anything, Siri|Sabrina's face is as shocked as Kendra's and Hannah's.

Kendra gives a nervous laugh, but recovers quickly. "Is this, like, the designated loser bathroom and I never got the memo?"

"You're just like your cousin," Hannah says to me. "One who'll always follow in the footsteps of girls like me and Kendra|We’ll be lucky if they don’t make up a juicy story to go with it.”
“I could never get used to this life,” Selena sighed. Even though she knew she would miss Matt horribly, she was looking forward to getting home and riding Rusty across the silent desert.
Matt took her hand on the table. “I’m really going to miss you, Selena|My wife.

Before she could respond, he turned to leave. Sarah rose and started after him.

"Wait-Miles. Don't leave."

Without stopping, he spoke over his shoulder. "Why? So you can get on my case some more?"

"I'm not on your case, Miles|They hastened to baggage claim , talking non stop, then 

fidgeted while waiting for the two suitcases to spill over 

onto the conveyer belt. Finally they appeared; each grabbed 

a case and began rolling them toward the door. A few 

moments later, they labored to lift the bags into the 

trunk. 

“ Jeeez, Mom, what did you pack|It appeased me somewhat to know that when I left on my date with Sam, the three of them would get a verbal tongue-lashing that would make their threats to Sam seem like child's play.

When she turned back she held a hand out to my date. "Elodie Nichols, it's lovely to meet you, Sam|"I know! I'll bake a few cakes a day and sell the slices to your customers. Soon, I'll do its name justice."

"I'm not sure-"

"I'll give you fifty percent of the profits," she rushed out. "And don't you dare say there won't be any profits|‘There was an unregistered flight detected on radio by both the Indonesian and Australian Air forces around the time the tip-off predicted, but the plane veered off towards Borneo where it somewhat skillfully dropped below radar. So, if we want to find out what Pei’s been up to, we’ll have to go ask her ourselves.’
‘Is that what you have in mind for me?’
‘Not exactly. I have a team ready to go to Borneo|Keith had passed over twenty years on earth since Horatius had last seen him. The Highlander’s hair had thinned and lost its color, letting his red scalp show through the thin white strands that were left. His head and nose had thickened, and his ears hung low and large. 
Horatius slid onto a high-backed carved chair across from Keith|She returned her bag to the room and met Vasquez in the kitchen having a cup of coffee.
“I thought the captain was sending someone to relieve you,” said Katrina.
“He did, you were sleep when Roberts and Williams came last night.  We’ve been placed on twelve hour rotations.  We relieved them about an hour or so ago,” said Vasquez|I've lost perspective."

"It's not a question of fairness. You took the file to right a wrong. You did not intend to steal it, just borrow it for an hour or so. It was an honorable act, but still a theft."

"Did DeOrio refer to it as a theft|But the police would listen only to him, and now...” She bowed her head, overcome.
Susan didn’t want to push, but it was unbearable to know only part of it. “You’re not Victor’s wife?”
“My aunt.” Elizabeth’s voice shook. “She was Victor’s wife.”
“Was?”
“She died the year after they were wed.”
That might explain a thing or two about Victor|“If, by some miracle, it makes it through the Senate and House Bills without the press attention, I’m on the conference committee, and it won’t survive.
“That’s important to me, Senator (and why I pay for your services).”
“Have a good day, Luca.”
“And you, as well, Senator|You could see the gleam in his eyes.
Soon, a school of curious fish swarmed around Hydra and Pluggo. Hydra knew that the fish would soon be nipping at them so he told Pluggo to swim faster.
Hydra was fully focused, recalling the path to the cave. Sensing he found it, he swam up to the surface, followed closely by Pluggo|You'll be, uh, playacting. Not actually performing any duties. The gender disparity you're seeing here isn't an accident." He nodded to Lucian, Phil, George, and Justin. "They-and myself-are the principle players on this trip. This is what the Arcadians will expect. It wouldn't even occur to them that important, powerful diplomats would be anything but men|I was amazed by how knowledgeable she was on the subject and she told me her grandfather had taught her before he died a few years ago.

Hours later, when we stopped for the night, my magic vibrating through me stronger than ever, L didn't build us a fire. When I asked why, shivering in my jacket, she told me it would attract the mountain dogs. My heart had thudded in my chest as I remembered warnings from Brint about the dogs|"That's what makes it fun," she told him, and slipped out of his grasp to walk beneath the awning and into the aisle that wound its way past at least thirty different booths.

She wandered through the crowd, sensing Nick's presence behind her. She glanced at tables set up with sterling silver rings and necklaces, leather coin purses and crocheted shawls that hung in colorful bunches from a rope stretched across the front of a booth|Usually the mind games and power plays with Salvatore were fun. But not tonight. At least having Hillary here in his suite made it easier to keep an eye on her.

Troy called to Hillary without looking up from the keyboard, "I ordered coffee and some food in case it turns into a long night."

"I'll take the coffee but pass on the food|It was touch and go for a while, but you're a fighter and between us we exorcised that poison from your system in the end."
"Poison?" Tom queried.
"Yes indeed," the doctor told him, "nasty stuff too. Nothing that I've ever seen before. Most peculiar."
"It was the Wolf," Tom said very quietly. "It was in another form, but it was the Wolf|He handed me my bow, saying soberly, “Yet you may not leave, for you are needed here. Furthermore, my lady, you should be thankful that the High-Chief Joined with you. Humbled, even.”
“Humbled? I hardly see why.”
“Enough of such talk.” Obviously he disapproved of both my ignorance and ingratitude. “I was sent to oversee your training, not bandy words|Ignoring my apology, Dean handed the letter over to me and I began to read it aloud. "Today's challenge is a special one. You're guaranteed to have some fun. Pack your bags and pack your things. Who knows what tomorrow brings?" I flipped it over, just to check if anything was written on the back, and then frowned and handed it back to Dean|Kurt glares at me. "I'm the one trying to finish my homework. You're the one bringing him in here."

"Actually, I brought myself in here. And I'm still here." Josh points at himself. "Hi."

"This is my room," I say to Kurt|She put it on my lips as Taylor tried not to jab my eye out with mascara.

"Isn't this unsanitary?" I said. "Shouldn't you be disinfecting that before you stick it near my eye?" Renee was a big proponent of hand sanitizer and disinfecting things and coughing in your elbow.

"Are you saying that you don't want to share my germs|I'm so upset, I can't even cook." With that unprecedented statement, she stormed off to her room.

"Looks like delivery," said Justin, watching her go. When he noticed Tessa, his expression turned wry. "And you. You brought a reporter under my roof."

"I didn't really expect a family argument," said Tessa|After a quick exchange with one of his men, who had located a wide patch of fog, Isak put his radio back. "I've got to go, too. Where's your bike?"

"Just another block over that way." She pointed because it was in the opposite direction of his men. "I'll watch out for the fog|There was a short pause, and then Iceman spoke. “We launch our fighters and use the gas giant’s atmosphere against them. Our recon drones will monitor their position and speed as they refuel. The fighters will enter the atmosphere far enough away that the enemy won’t spot them.

"You are two men and a boy. We are three-and-thirty. How do you propose to stop us crossing?"

"Well", said Dunk, "I'll tell you. But only you".

"As you wish". She pressed her heels into her horse and rode her out into the stream|The man looked to his wife, and she gave her permission.

"Listen," he said, looking to Dad, "it's too dangerous to walk. We're headed to Shallot. My in-laws live there. We've been driving all night from Midland."

"You made it here all the way from Midland|“Is she ready?” Syll inquired.
“We’ll find out when we wake her.”
“Transfer her to her cell, doctor. When she awakes...”
“If she awakes.”
“As you say. Then I want her in a secure location.”
They used a grav sled to transfer her to the cell|The surgeon, Dr. Sam Collins, opened the door to Kate’s room and stepped inside to check on her progress. He was taken aback by what he saw. He saw a shimmering golden light and this mysterious cloaked man holding an object over her. At first, he thought it might be the one who had shot her returning to try and finish the job. He shot a look over at Jhahnahkan and grabbed him from behind and pulled him back away from Kate|Those years had been awful from what Donna could remember, until Mr. Applegate’s youngest son became her best friend....
Rebecca’s big college calculator slipped out of her sweatshirt pocket onto the ground. The sound brought Donna back to reality as she knelt down to pick it up for her.
“Can’t you store test answers in those things?” Spencer asked. 
“You could if you wanted to.” 
Donna felt that heat in her left hand again, as she held the calculator|Juan was perspiring. Adrian was biting her lower lip. Adrian’s mother and father appeared to be statues. I didn’t think they would come. Juan’s parents were beaming. They always loved Adrian and were eager to make her an official part of the family. Too bad Adrian’s parents didn’t feel the same about Juan|The ring may not have much more of a story to tell anyway."
"Still, someone's got to try, otherwise you'll all think I'm some sort of a nut case."
"We won't," said Gill.
"Well I might think that I am myself," said Steve.
"All right, I'll try it on," said Gill|Very slowly, terror and anger struggling for supremacy, Tom met the eyes of a man seated before him at a large mahogany desk. He appeared to be quite young, no more than thirty or so and he shuffled some papers before tucking them away inside a drawer.
"There's a lot of work to be done, Tom|"The DEA's getting pulled in on this one," Mercer said. "They're going to investigate Ken, break apart his life and follow the trail they find back to the muerte."

The muerte trail already led to Slade. So he had to ask, "Are you questioning my brother?"

"Any intel that Slade can provide to us about the men who held him and addicted him will be used by the DEA|"Why do you not go through, and look for him?"

"Because ..." said the star, and then she stopped. "Aye," she said. "Perhaps I shall." The sky above them was striped with grey and white bands of cloud, through which patches of blue could be seen. "I wish my mother were out," said the star|How long?”
Damien focused for a moment, testing the reserve of energy buried deep inside of him. It had recovered somewhat during his hour-long nap. The gravity spell wasn’t a major strain, and from the feel, he could handle anything that wasn’t major.
Of course, a teleport spell was the definition of major|"What's the matter with her?"

"Diarrhea," said Lesley. "Very bad. Spends all her time sitting on the loo."

"Ew, spare us the details!" said Cynthia. "Can I look at your essays, then, you two?"

"We haven't finished them yet," said Lesley|If anything ever happened to you, they'd have to dig two graves. I couldn't live if I lost you.

“Thank you, Eve,” Gabriel said and smiled at her.
She bowed again and hurried away.
Dani watched her disappear into a tent. “What was that about?” she asked as she stared down at the goblet|She pressed her dainty hands on either side of his face, and bent her head as if in prayer.

A series of short yelps rose up from the trees nearby. They were closer now.

"The two of you need to get Nika away from here," said Angus to the humans. "We'll follow shortly."

"I'm not leaving him," said Nika|“That doesn’t mean to say it will work.”
“No, I want to hear,” said Dave. “What about the rifts?”
“Doesn’t he know about the Islands of Rednuht and Retawnair?” Jordan asked.
“The what?”
“The rifts.”
“I know of the rifts,” said Dave|Part of the Dominion asymmetric warfare division. Not men you want to encounter in the dead of night. Well, not men you really want to encounter at all, honestly.”
“It looked like they were headed somewhere.”
“Probably headed south, towards Valencia.”
“Why though? I thought Valencia had been annexed by the Dominion|I'm sure my dad must've been hotness to have caught my mom's married eye, but he had been very human. Hooking up with humans wasn't prohibited by any means, mainly because the children-half-bloods like me-were extremely valuable assets to the pures. Well, I couldn't be included as an asset any longer.

Now I was just... I didn't know what I was anymore|Lizzie looked pale and her mouth opened and closed without a sound. 
“I’m just kidding. I wouldn’t do that to you.”
With a sigh of relief she laughed and went right into her thoughts about what I should wear. I handed her the apron and grabbed the bag of cinnamon rolls.
“Thanks for watching the shop, Lizzie|Sometimes, when Dr. Chaudhary laughed at something Eliza said, or leaned over her shoulder to read some results, she could see Morgan's nasty assumptions in his smirk, and it enraged her. It dirtied her-and Dr. Chaudhary, too, who was decent, and married, and also old enough to be her father. Eliza was used to being underestimated, because she was black, because she was a woman, but no one had ever been quite so vile about it as Morgan|Let them.”
Betty threw glances at her. Barbara understood.
“Jeff, would you mind bringing me another drink?” she asked.
“Of course. I was about to get another myself. The same again for you?”
“Yes, please. Could you stay at the bar until I finish my conversation with Betty|Or worse--she'd call security.

Her eyes took me in with disdain. "I'm assuming you don't moonlight as a maid," she said. "Though it that get up..."

I didn't get offended. I was sure she had much worse up her sleeve. "No, I'm not the maid|He shouldn’t be afraid of Justin, regardless of how much bigger he was. Dizzy was just a kid and Justin couldn’t hurt him without significant punishment. Dizzy took a breath to calm down and turned back to the pig.
	“Just solving this clue,” Dizzy said. He held up the phone and took a picture of the pig|Joe Roy Spicer didn't write very well. He coordinated the scam, helped with the fiction, kept the stories straight, and met with the lawyer who brought the mail. And he handled the money.

He pulled out another letter and announced, "This, Your Honors, is from Quince."

Everything stopped as Beech and Yarber stared at the letter|"And I haven't been told any differently. I'm nothing in the big scheme of things, but I'm not blind."

I held my breath. I felt Blake do the same.

"What are you saying?" Daemon asked.

Lane smiled tightly. "I know who's in your house, Daemon|The tiger lies low not from fear, but for aim....

Wren blinked, then seemed to calm himself. He wiped down the table, picked up his tub, and moved on.

At least he tried to.

As he walked past the booth, the man shoved him. Wren stumbled and almost dropped the dishes. But at the last minute, true to his tigard genes, he caught his balance and kept the dishes from spilling out of his tub|* * * * *

Despite the droopy rim of her sun hat, the unrelenting sunlight made Teria tired. She leaned backward on the bleachers and stretched her back.
"You should get her a drink, Leo." Leo's father leaned around his son and gave Teria yet another one of his weighing stares. 
"No, I'm fine," said Teria|They might do it out of ignorance or from some stricture of Caleban morality which the rest of the ConSentiency did not share or understand. Or for some other reason which defied translation. They said they looked upon all life as "precious nodes of existence." But hints at peculiar exceptions remained. What was it Fannie Mae had once said?

"Dissolved well this node."

How could you look at an individual life as a "node|"To blend with his flier and give an overall impression of darkness," said Solovet.

"The gnawers will not be impressed by an impression of darkness," Miravet said, still stubbornly holding the breastplate she had chosen.

"No, but the humans will. It implies deadliness and strength and will give them confidence to follow him," said Solovet|"Get me the base security commander."

His fingers tapped a tattoo on the desk like a drummer beating eighteenth- and nineteenth-century regiments into battle.

“So, you have experienced a drastic decline in attendance, is that what you are telling this court?”
“Throughout the congregations. Yes,” said Moses.
“Do you have any statistical evidence that this is the case?” said Jones.
“You know I do,” said Moses|I don't have to turn around to know it's Eldest speaking, but I do, one hand on the girl's glass box, as if I could protect her from Eldest's attention.

"How did you get down here?" Eldest's words are terse. He's angry, but maybe not at me.

“You're very serious.”
“Okay, I'm very serious,” agreed Eloisa|"This whole thing is explosive," Scytale said in a calmer voice. "It's ready to shatter. When it goes, it will send bits of itself out through the centuries. Don't you see this?"

In the stillness Ananda hears the silent wondering of Tathagata, soon to be Ruth Marten. Soon to set forth again from Tusita Heaven.
And in the same stillness, he answers him: “I am here, Tathagata. In this cabin. At this keyboard. Dreaming your new arrival into being.”
Tathagata asks: “Where is here, Ananda|"Move it, slowpoke."

Earlier, I was curious why Tori didn't want me wearing jeans and a T-shirt tonight. She insisted that I wear her little black cocktail dress, the one she reserves for special occasions. That right there should've been a huge red flag.

"What are you up to, Tori|The little girl has skipped off to the trailers and the line of kids to be measured has dispersed. I'm left alone with the weight of my sins.

"Jonah?" Stella crouches beside me. "Are you okay?"

I'm not okay. None of this okay. The fact that there are kids who have parents who can't afford shoes that fit or shoes at all, that's not okay|It was a big deal, but thousands of bands auditioned for it every year. Our chances of getting on were pretty slim.
He nodded. “I know it’s a long shot, but I don’t see a reason not to try.”
“Might as well.” I didn’t think anything would come of it, but it always made Jared feel better when he had something to do for the band|This is a non-smoking venue,"

The woman who'd answered the phone hesitated only a second. "Sorry-we're all booked that day. Would you like to try another date?"

Mia froze, one foot into the pair of slacks she intended to wear to work. "What do you mean you're all booked|Jones then walked over to his desk and was handed a sheaf of papers by his young male associate. He turned to Judge Moore, holding up the report. “We’d like to enter the People’s exhibit number one into the record.”

“Yes, your honor.”
Judge Moore looked over at Ruth who nodded, yes, she had a copy|Slowly, silently, I reach out and slip the glass out of her hand.

"What do you think you're doing?"

The old lady's voice startles me and I jump back. Mrs. Reynolds has one eye open like that guy from the cartoon monster movie. "I, uh, thought you were napping."

I shook my head. "No, I just want to skip dinner and fast forward to the kiss goodnight." And this time I wanted to bask in the fact that he really knew it was me that he was kissing|He took his phone and opened it while walking outside. They were in such a secluded area no one would ever find them. They were tucked back in the wilderness of the Rocky Mountains, an hour outside of Colorado Springs. Derrik placed a call. 
“Hello?” Adara said franticly into the phone.
“Adara, don’t say my name, this is Derrik|In fact, if you stop to consider, it might even boost her, if that’s even conceivable.”
“How so?” asked Miller.
“She’s a rebel,” offered Jones. “And rebels tend to thrive in cross-fire, don’t they?”
“I see your point,” said Miller|My heart pounded suddenly, as if I'd just fallen in love. I beamed back at him as exaggeratedly as a children's TV show host.

Sally Allison said, "Your lips are gonna fall off if you keep that up."

I jumped. "Why'd you go and scare me like that, Sally|Ashlyn was the new mother of the warrior's twin babies.

For a long while, Kane watched Ashlyn, silent. She was a delicate beauty with honey-colored hair and skin, and she swayed in a rocker, singing to the bundle of joy clutched lovingly in her arms. Beside her, Maddox swayed in a second rocker|I continued working nervously. He took another swig of his beer before stepping forward to the island. He placed the bottle on the counter and pushed my hair from my face. I cringed, pulling away from his fingers, desperate to escape the scrutiny.

"You look different." His shook his head, his face puzzled, trying to put his finger on the change|“We’ll get everyone together and we’ll all tell her about you, and how great you are with always having band-aids, and advice, and food when kids are left behind without any, and-and how you show new tempies how to take care of themselves, and well everything.”
“I don’t think she would be impressed,” Zeke looked down at Simps. Oh, he knew for a fact that Shari wouldn’t be impressed|'Yes, miss?'

'Have you been out in the woods all morning?'

'Oh, yes, miss.'

'Have you seen Granny Weatherwax?'

'Yes, miss.'

'You have?'

'Yes, miss.'

'Where?'

'Up in the woods over towards the border, miss|You will see it coming and when it comes you will know what I speak of, now go! Gather the armies! You must ride and strike out at the very heart of Solace.”   
Solharn rose up into the sky, spinning as he ascended. Abednego breathed a sigh of relief. No longer would he have to look at Solharn|Trust me, it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission."

Zhang released a breath she'd unconsciously been holding. "Dominic, I'll owe you for this."

Dominic said, "No, you won't. You're a good friend to my wife. That goes a long way with me." He cleared his throat and said, "I'd like to see you happy, Zhang|“I stole it from that church on Scarborough Street then, as I did now,” he said proudly, lifting up the cross so that Alexander and I could get a better look at it.
Then Nicholas Pavlovich continued his story. “My father laughed at me,” he said. “My father challenged me, asking ‘What kind of good Jewish boy comes bearing crosses?’ But his laughter stopped when he got a closer look at the cross|* * *
In Athens Demosthenes continued his series of speeches against Philip, known to history as his "philippics". He denounced Philip, as the tyrant of the north, bent on crushing all Greece under his heel. A talented orator, he urged the people against any accommodation with Macedon. He and Hyperiedes led the party of war in Athens against Philip's ambitions.
Aeschines and Phocion, the leaders of the party urging peace with Philip, were talking in Phocion’s spacious villa outside the gates of Athens|“Although we visited the cave often when Draga was hiding here we only saw how he was living and, when he was gone, we respected his memory by not touching anything. We had no way of knowing if he had anything valuable that was worth stealing.”
“Did you see your visitor again after he had been to the cave|I have something special I want to talk to you about. Believe me, you don't want to miss this.

Love and kisses, Faye

P.S. Don't tell anyone in the Club you're coming to see me. You'll understand when you get here.

Cassie was tingling with alarm. Her first impulse was to call Diana, but if Diana had been up all night purifying the skull, she was probably exhausted|"I haven't told anyone yet, but Mrs. Kimball is going on maternity leave in August, and I suspect she won't be back. I've heard whispers that she's planning to open an in-home day care when her baby's a few months old."

"She teaches three-year-olds, right?" Better than the twos, anyway.

The director nodded. "Are you interested in taking over for her in August|And that's it.

A reporter buddy once told me that in newspapers, when you leave out some important piece of information at the beginning of a story, they call it burying the lede.

So I just want to make sure I don't bury the lede.

Though it wouldn't be the first thing I've buried|He has no rights.  I command you to tell me where he is!”

“Command denied.  Please enter the password now.”

Moses snapped off the terminal.  There were few places in the ship in which Hack could hide.  He guessed the shuttles.  If anywhere, Hack would be in one of the shuttles|As they waited for the opening act to begin they talked and people watched, Mia`s mom Sharon had chosen to keep an eye on the girls from a much safer distance. She wanted no part of the mob of people squeezed in front of the stage. Selah glanced back at her occasional, her excitement mounting as they had managed to be a mere 10 feet from the stage. They had made sure that they stayed glued together, Selah had brought her camera and her phone took very clear pictures, she took a trial picture to see how  it would be from the distance they were from the stage|Riley grabbed the remote control and turned it off. ‘I’ve got something for you to do.’
‘Alright, was is it?’ said Nashy, flicking back her damp, fresh smelling hair with the same lack of ceremony it seemed she had ended her phone call with her husband.
‘Breeze’s waterfront escapade is still fresh in the papers,’ said Riley|By the time I came to my senses, I found myself making love to Emilia. She clutched the back of my head and whispered into my ear, "He punished you for turning your back on him. He rewarded me for bringing you back to him. You are my reward, Derek."

At that moment, even as her body bucked and writhed beneath mine, I hated her with every fiber of my being, and yet the words that came out of my mouth were, "I love you, Emilia|“Lil’ man, you want to go to bed?”
He shook his head and rubbed his eyes, she watched him look up at her grinning and then reaching out for the kitten. “Was waiting for you Aunt Dia. Where did you go; did you get us donuts?”
“I went for a run, and no, I didn’t get you donuts|Mack scooped her up and swung her around, holding her high above his head.

"That's my girl!"

"She did it! She did it!" Excited, Mary Jo started waving her arms. Noelle was a week and a half from being ten months old and had taken her first step. "That's early for her to be walking|A pressure in my brain darkens my vision momentarily – the wolf pushing for control. I push back, and my sight clears. I’ve stopped running. Suddenly my human side with its gift of reason presses to the forefront.
traps beware of traps
I stand stock still in the snow, looking around. How would I be able to tell if there was a trap|25
Seated motionless on a concrete ledge approximately half way up his driveway—between a plastic Colonel Sanders hand puppet and an old Flexible Flyer sled—Red stared vacantly into the night. It was an evocative but disquieting image. When Mike returned with his shirt—now a sodden orb—he placed it against Red’s sweaty forehead. 
“Hold it against your head, okay? Can you do that for me, Red|"How much will you agree to?"

"Six months max. And it's not negotiable. Look, Judge, these guys are scared to death, you know that. They're scared and we're not. Why should we settle anything? I'd rather have a jury."

"There's not going to be a jury|"Gramma appreciated all you did for her over the last few years."
"It was the least we could do," Mrs. Townsend said, releasing Gracie from her grasp. "Cordelia was always the first one to pitch in when others needed help."
Cordelia. The sound of her grandmother's Christian name startled Gracie. She knew Gramma Del but she would never know Cordelia|He wanted to reassure the farmer somehow, like Quentin would have done, but he didn’t dare take his eyes off Lisa; wasn’t even sure he could take his eyes off her as long as she held his gaze. He couldn’t even think.
Lisa rose on shaky legs and covered herself with blood-coated hands. “Jim! Help me!”
Richard leaned into Paddington’s peripheral vision, distraction enough for Paddington to look away from Lisa|"You're right," Smith said soberly, "they'll start searching the neighborhood soon."

"Swell. Just what I wanted to hear." Marty grinned weakly. It came out as a macabre grimace, but it was a brave try.

Smith squeezed his friend's shoulder, trying to keep the urgency from his voice. "How did they know about us, Marty|Again, as if not wholly trusting her internal tongue, she also spoke this aloud.
“On some level, yes. Always,” said Ruth, who, if she noticed, did not wonder at, nor did she comment on the words leaving her mother’s lips along with its shared sister-thought.
“But man prefers ignorance to terror,” continued Ruth|What do you want him for?”
“Get him,” I told her. “He and I have a talk coming, and right now is as good a time as any.”
Elsie glared at me and drew herself up straight.
“Now you listen here, Hill William.” 
“No,” I interrupted, “you listen|Miranda responded immediately. "Shirley, come over here. We need your opinion."

Great. Now she was going to be drawn into this argument, too. She walked toward them and glanced at the painting that seemed to be the subject of their disagreement. "Are you ready for the movie, Miranda|It’s strange that this one is empty of water though.” Dalya rubbed her right hand on her chin as she stared quizzically down into the hole. 

Declan noticed how the glowing light reflected off his sister’s long brown hair. Suddenly, the glow became brighter and a misty cloud of rays splayed toward them. Just then, a blinding light engulfed the unsuspecting on-lookers, and in a few seconds all went dark in the hole|Now Christy had two mysteries in front of her: the boy and the end of the oddly darkened rink. As she looked at the odd boy, she began to wonder where he had come from. Somewhere or somehow, she felt as though she had met him before. 
 “Hello,” said Christy, “and thank you.” The boy smiled cautiously. Christy continued, “I thought I was the only one left at the rink|It was still sitting in the trunk of the car, and now, seeing him with that sword in his hand, it seemed unimpressive.

I found Leah by the jewelry as she was looking at a small silver necklace.

I asked, "Hey, would you mind walking with him to go get some hot cider while I get something real quick?"

"Sure," she answered, taking one last look at the necklace before gathering up Connor in search of cider|Suddenly the evening was brighter, even the fire cast a cheerier glow about the room. All he had to do was secure a governess. And that couldn’t be hard to do. He’d simply inquire about and interview prospective persons. Better yet, Mrs. Pott, the housekeeper, could interview. She’d be far more capable and wise in knowing what made a good governess|And wait she did, although when the time came, she was too thrilled about the trip for the episode with the prince of Rêeh to matter as much. She and her company left the palace in two full coaches with her guards riding along on horses, and they met up with Commander Alexander’s small band to head out of the capital together. Constance did not get to greet Staid personally until they all made it to Nonpareil, when Staid insisted on being the one to help Constance, in her modish traveling suit and feathered hat, out of her coach|“Everything else is as good as could be expected, in fact, to be honest, he’s doing better than someone in his condition.  Either he’s a very lucky young man, or someone very special is looking after him.”  Sue flashed a weak smile at her friend.
“Lucky? Lucky?”  Eric asked in the solidified world he now lived within.  “I’m in a coma and you think I’m lucky|Waiting and searching, and repeating the words of the prophecy to ourselves, in our dreams, as we wake and as we pray. We have expected your coming for such a long time now, Ella, it is a wonder that you have finally come to us.

With these final words, Oisin turned his gaze to Ella|"Since when do you smoke?" asked Jay.
"Since I started drinking," Ben kidded, trying to lighten the
mood somewhat.
With the first stream of smoke he drew back, Ben
coughed and spluttered, screwing his face up at the
putrid habit. He looked at the cigarette and handed it
back to Jay|Thomas struggled to find an excuse to drag Jacque’s chair along with them into the new office. 
	“Wait, it’s that old? Doesn’t seem like it. I mean, the chair still looks alright to me.”
They all eyed each other-some turned their heads and snickered. Keith walked over to him.
	“Tommy, get up-step away from the chair|"I knew Shelby in Vietnam," he began. "He helped me get through it."

I nodded, just to show I was registering this information. "After the war... after our part of the war ... I'd met some intelligence people in Vietnam. I spoke some Spanish already, and so did Shelby|As she got the mail, she laughed at herself for being silly. 
A stern Vermonter voice startled the thought from her. “I never could find any humor in mail.”

* * *

 “Oh, I wasn’t laughing at the mail, Mrs. Hirson.” Shelley seemed defensive. Nobody seemed to get her humor. Not even Roger after forty years of marriage could get her humor|"I want everyone to know that my daughter memorized that address in a matter of minutes," boasted Mrs. Billings. 
"That is remarkable, and indeed good to know, Mrs. Billings," answered Mr. Niles.
"She gets that ability from me," confided Mrs. Billings to the entire room.
"How fortunate," concluded Mr. Niles.
"Naturally you wouldn't wish to have someone without proper memorization skills in a leading role, now would you, Mr. Niles|In just a few moments she was already finished.
"Is that it?" Joey asked, looking at me as if I knew more than Darcy would. I nodded and smiled.
"Thank you, Darcy," I said, turning toward her and extending my hand. She brushed it aside and gave me another warm embrace before turning and doing the same with Joey|Or, wishing herself at home in her own cabin, or house, or castle. “I wish we could forget the whole thing,” she said.
“Well, frankly,” said Flannery, “I wish we could, too.”
“I am tired of tidying up after him,” said Gabriel. And he was.
“He is our brother,” said Flannery|Bryn moved to her desk and pulled out her notebook and pencil.  She overheard Mrs. Frank tell him to choose any empty seat to sit in.  She was surprised to see him sit down in the desk just next to hers.
“Hello,” he murmured quietly.
“I didn’t realize you went to Lockwood Prep,” said Bryn|"You tell the council they'd better keep her alive. If she dies, you just lost a warrior!" said Gregor.

"Are you sure you wish me to say this?" asked Vikus.

"Why wouldn't I?" said Gregor.

"It gains you nothing and it reveals much of your hand," said Vikus|She was currently holding her guitar in its case. “I am not playing in public now.”
“No, but why are you holding a guitar outside a nightclub? Are you playing in the nightclub?”
Zoe didn’t want to answer that.
“Do you have any ID on you?”
“I didn’t know I was supposed to carry an ID at all times,” said Zoe|I missed it the week I spent cuddling Ben and Jerry.

I'm not going to feel sorry for myself anymore. I'm not running from life anymore either.

Raising my hand, I knock on Mom's office door. There should be nerves, but there aren't. Or maybe they're there, but my willpower is stronger than the nerves|I had it all wrong—
Finn Daley: You’ve got that right.
Casey Scott: I know; that’s what I just said. 
Finn Daley: Just want to make sure you’re not still delusional.
Casey Scott: Hey, you’ve had your say. I think it’s time I’ve had mine|With a powerful shove of his palms against the men's shoulders, Morgan and Neal went flying in opposite directions.

Nicholas dodged his airborne buddies and stepped in front of Lexi as if to protect her. From Zach.

"Out of the way," growled Zach.

"Not until you've cooled off, man," said Nicholas|Zach watched as the two of them argued. Mike's words swam in his head: this is Hollywood, and nothing is ever as it seems.

"Look at it this way. Do you want the guy selling you your Ford to be driving a Toyota? No, you want the guy to drive a Ford|If Kasar didn't want her, then she would have to get over him and find someone else to love. "Mother, why do you and father fight so much?" she asked.

Nadia's surprised eyes snapped over to look at her daughter's worried expression. "Fight?" she laughed. "Your father and I don't really fight|"Dragonflies," he said. "The Jurassic was a time of huge insects."

"Do they bite?" Lex said.

"I don't think so," Grant said.

Tim held out his band. One of the dragonflies lighted on it. He could feel the weight of the huge insect|It would all be there, waiting for him when he was done, but until then, he would occupy this gray, meaningless place to keep Nika safe from himself.

Grace plastered a bright smile on her face and walked into Torr's suite. "How are you doing today?" she asked, trying to sound like her usual cheerful self.

"Better now that you're here," said Torr|"All I can say is, I'm sorry," Luca continued, those words exploding in Jai's head like shrapnel. "I'm sorry for what I did and didn't do, and I'm sorry that sorry won't ever be enough."

Everyone sat silent, the room thick with tension.

And then Luca murmured, "I'm proud of you, Jai|The cook's out on guard, and all of this was just too much for mother.  She tried to help, but we finally made her go upstairs and lay down."
"When the fighting starts you'd better get her back down here an' near some outside door.  If they set fire to this house, she might get trapped if she's still upstairs|Graham must have looked ill equipped to answer this, because Harry stepped in before he could speak. "We'll call you back, Rach, okay?" he said. "Just keep us posted."

"Okay," she said, just before hanging up. "But try to stay out of trouble."

When she was gone, Harry glanced over at Graham|"I hate seeing such a beautiful woman so uptight."

"You want to give me a back rub?"

He grinned. "I'd prefer to give you a full body massage, but I'm guessing I'll have to wait for that privilege."

"Privilege? Giving me a massage would be a privilege|We stood in the old Quaker meetinghouse where I'd first encountered Black Cross the year before. The chill of consecrated ground crept into my bones and made me shake. Charity clung to a doorjamb, as if she had to hold herself upright.

"We don't have to hide," I told her. "Lucas won't hurt us."

"You don't have to hide from Lucas|"We'll have to do it again sometime."

Ben inserted himself between Roper and the director. "I'd be happy to. There's a script idea I've been toying with. A ballplayer who couldn't make it in the minors due to a tragic past."

Harrison nodded, listening politely. "Call me and we'll talk," he said to Ben|"She took a wrong turn a few miles ago. I will drive both of you to the others. You must sleep, Darius."

"I must protect Tempest." It was an implacable statement, an order given by a being used to being obeyed.

Tempest leaned her head against his leg. "You're about as much protection as a wet noodle right now, Darius|Get it together; we're burning daylight," Frank yells. Austin looks at me and shrugs before taking off hiking again.

"You better be careful, Austin, you could easily be confused with a bear," I tell his back. His hand raises over his shoulder so he can flip me off. I start to jog so I'm not so far behind and pray we don't see a bear|“I’m going, I’m going,” says Josh, getting down on hands and knees and lowering himself into the hole.
I take hold of the rope and turn away, unable to watch. “Be careful,” I say once more, this time through gritted teeth.
“I will,” he replies, giving me one last look before disappearing into the hole|When Sully didn’t get a response, he jabbed Wally hard in the side with his elbow, throwing the wily con artist off balance. Still, the man didn’t answer. He remained transfixed by what was happening on the stage.
“Wally, you better not be wasting my time.”
Wally lifted his right hand and pointed at the stage|He cleared his throat before continuing, "It was Kiran's idea to send me with Talbott. Lucan originally wanted to send Lilly; he thought she was less of a threat and the most compelling bargaining chip, but Kiran insisted that I would be stronger leverage. Kiran demanded that his father send me instead of Lilly|He dug out this book to show me with a lot of paintings by a Renaissance artist, um, Piero della Francesca, and in one of them, it’s called ‘The Awakening’, I saw that one of the faces of the figures in it looked exactly like your husband’s.”
“And what did your friend Ced think of that?” asked Lily.
“He wanted to see John for himself. He was astounded by the likeness. So he came up here, to the gallery. That’s where he saw the other paintings|Riding on his rising rage he slammed forward in a surge to lean on the desk, his brown eyes no longer holding a warm welcome. “I want Arbiter,” he roared ruthlessly. Rook only blinked in response, his eerily iridescent eyes remaining calm against Marshall’s confrontation. “And I said that the Sheriff isn’t here right now,” replied Rook|Her face had angular features, which must have been pretty in her youth. Sun damaged skin freckled her cheeks, and wiry hair that was devoid of color framed her aged face. Her gaze was intensely focused on the book in her hands.

Eric cleared his throat.

The nun looked up and smiled, "Ah, Eric|Didn’t want you finding out the baby was still alive. Then she went to London because she didn’t want you to be the father. Once she’d had the child, she gave it away for adoption. A boy. I think she called it Daniel. He doesn’t know who his real mother is. I don’t even think he knows he’s adopted|So did my dad. He pulled me aside when you started dating Branch. He told me that there were plenty of other girls out there for me. He didn't get that I didn't want any other girls. It's the reason I started bringing random girls home. Part of it was because I thought you'd get jealous and want me instead of Branch|Exactly what is it that you want to get straightened out?'

'Watch, Sparhawk,' she told him. 'Watch and learn.'

'It's just not done, Kalten,' Alean said in a sorrowfully resigned voice as the two walked out across the drawbridge with Sparhawk and Danae not far behind.

'What do you mean, "not done|The demon stared at it in shock. His gaze slowly rose to meet Tome’s smug grin.
“Okay,” he said in his real voice. “I can explain this...”
“Let me guess,” Lil put in. “That was the Body Plop.”
“Astute as always, Lil,” said Tome|Elinor sat stiffly on his lap, trying to think of something witty to say to that. Something biting.
But her heart still pounded and she imagined her townhouse without him here waiting for her and she just couldn’t think of anything.
He ran his hand down her back. “This isn’t a secret between us, Elinor|Starling looked at him and retorted, “Coffee contentment is important, but there are other things in life which make one happy you know. Variety is the spice of life. Don’t you ever long to do something spontaneously that you’ve never done before?”
Linus had not often felt the need to be spontaneous|Do you have trust issues? Or you get bored easily? Or you've just never tried?"

He drops his hand away from my face.

"Dylan, I'm not sure what I want from you, but it isn't to be my shrink."

"I'm not trying to be your shrink|The doctor said that these beings were brought here for experiments. These creatures are not intelligent beings. EBE-2 then used the word animals. 
OK, now I understand. All these creatures are animals from other planets. The doctor didn't seem to understand the word animal. EBE-2 and the doctor exchanged words in Eben and the doctor then said, yes, they are animals|With work and applying to vet schools, I haven't even had time to go on a date in months," I said. I hoped he didn't think I sounded pathetic. He laughed and leaned back on his elbows, the tension gone from him again.

"I hear you on the too busy thing. Why do you think I came with my secretary? She's the only person I see on a daily basis I felt like I could ask," he laughed and then scowled at the thought of his secretary|There too, the issue had been maddenly unclear. She knew that Smith had loved Sophia deeply and would never have knowingly put her in harm's way. Yet, when she stood at her sister's grave, she still believed that he could have done something to save her.

Randi brushed away that last thought and turned to Smith|“That makes sense” 
“Your stuff is packed,” The third said this time. “We will provide assistance in any way that we can. Kyle should also have his guardian, Dylan, with him. Are you ready, James?” 
“Yes.” 
One then closed the conversation by saying, “Then good night, James|`The boss.  Some of the staff at the Castle,' Sovant was saying.  `A few of my associates - other bodyguards.'

`And how many bodyguards does Mr. Von Hellemann have?' asked officer Yuremevic.

`There's seven of us.  Four work outside the Castle and three work inside,' said Sovant|So Pandora's Box was something to do for after the votes? I mentally filed that tidbit away.

Both Alys and Chris shook their heads.

"All right, then. On with the challenge. This will be a fire-making challenge. The first one to build a fire and snap a rope, stays!"

I looked over at Jendan as we got up from our benches to make room for the fire-making challenge|Ellie was already making her way back toward the road, but he paused to pick it up, examining it for a moment before slipping it back into his pocket, where he hoped it would remain safe.

Mom glanced at her watch. "In a little bit," she said, then ducked back through the door along with the dog.

When she was gone, Quinn turned back to Ellie|“I actually prefer the one in Juarez, but it's too late to go across the border,” Dario stated.  “The traffic back would be impossible.”
“I hope the film wasn't too difficult to follow,” said Eloisa.
“What do you mean?” asked Dario.
“I mean with all the Spanish and everything,” explained Eloisa|He hadn't realized how hungry he was. He spoons a big helping of pasta on his plate, and she does the same.

Between bites, he says, "I want you to know that I'm totally OK with you and Thor."

She puts her fork down exasperatedly. "There's nothing going on between me and Thor|Beth, Luke, and a baby? It's going to cripple me."

"Ach, let Braden do it."

Joss laughed, but a masculine voice called out, "Let Braden do what?"

We both turned to the doorway to see Braden towering inside it. In his arms was Luke and hurtling toward her mother was Beth|The instant she had a clear view of the

intruder's back, she jumped.

She landed on top of her quarry, with a control hold on the person's wrist. But she already knew that

this wasn't going to be a fight to the death.

"Jez-ow-it's me!" Claire spluttered.

"I know it's you, Claire|As Noah got the ropes free, Max pushed in with a blanket to cover Lauren's nak*d body. Noah pulled her upward, wrapping her in the blanket, ignoring Max's demands that he see to his sister's well-being.

Ryan and Dillon tried to pull Liam back, their questions urgent about his wound. They tried to get him to sit down, but he shook them off, only wanting to get to Lauren|His gaze lifted, eyes flaring sapphires. A half smile appeared on his lips as he buckled her in. "The guy seems like a dork."

A surprised laugh escaped her. "You don't even know him."

"Neither do you." He flashed a quick smile. "So for all you know, he definitely could be a dork|"Nola." He gestured for her to close the rest of the gap between them. "Lauren, I would like for you to meet my...friend, Nola."

Friend? Nola turned the word around in her head. She could live with that description. Heaven knows she didn't expect him to announce to his daughter that they were lovers|They continued to discuss the site's Web ring and what kind of coded messages to leave until Peter suddenly shouted: "Hold fast! Bogies at ten o'clock!"

The RV gave a wild lurch to the right, swaying so far over for a second it rode on two wheels. A volley of shots exploded from the forest. Glass flew and metal ripped at the back of the RV|Now she was winging it, and realized she could do anything she wanted and didn’t have to worry any more about whether she could control herself.
He studied her, his jacket over his shoulder, film camera at his side, smiling. “Look, what about your art? We haven’t even talked about it. Could we meet again, in a couple of days and we’d just talk about your art|"Yeah. It's true," said Joseph, "but I'd really rather you not help spread the rumor any farther than it already has."

"Where?" asked Iain.

"Where what?"

"Where did they find these things?"

"There was only one," said Joseph|“In the stillness of the page,” said Heather into the silence that followed, “when nothing but ink on white will stir the seeing eye, when nothing but the soul itself is left to bring alive the world once traced by inky fingers on willing paper.”
Flannery added, “When nothing but the deepest knowing, the stillness behind those reading eyes, shines awake the meaning, to build, word by word, a world as full and fuller than that which made the ink, than that which made the paper|He clenched his hand around his glass as he glared across at Adrian. "Ridiculous? Just what exactly is so ridiculous about it? Isn't she good enough for you, Adrian? She was good enough to be your friend, but when it comes to making her your wife, the thought of it is ridiculous to you? You should be ashamed of yourself, Adrian|"Yet," he added emphatically.

"Called? By whom?"

"Fahl."

"To do what?"

"To make good on your deal."

"What deal?"

"I told you before, people make different deals, have for...forever I guess."

"But I told you I didn't make any deals|"Carter said he'd let me play with his dog."

Ms. Jensen beamed at him. "It's good to share. I'm proud of you, Carter." With that, she turned into the classroom and left the two of them waiting in the hallway.

All during their arithmetic lesson, Carter's thoughts wandered to what his friends would say after Christmas when he didn't have his dog|I want you on my team, working for me and finding ways to improve the way we work around here."

Sydney sighed with relief at that. "Thank you," she said with a slight smile. "Can I get back to you on both?"

His lips thinned with irritation. "No. Who else is offering you a job, Sydney|You cannot leave women alone, not even those traveling with us practically as family. Rusti had a terrible experience yesterday. Did you give that a thought when you went to satisfy your own urges?"

"Syndil." Barack looked hurt. Syndil had a sweet, loving nature and was never angry, never upset with any of them.

"Do not 'Syndil' me, Barack|The Wolf-Lady lowered her eyes and examined the carpet. She didn’t want to make a spectacle of herself. Zev and the driver sat down at the small square table, then the Wolf-Lady. Evans sat down last, after bringing out a briefcase and laying it open on the table.  
“I think the time has come to make some plans,” said Evans|“It was yummy,” I cried, wiping the tears from my eyes, “it’s just my sister.”
Bentley sauntered over to me. “Oh, Candice. What happened?”
“Sticks and stones will break my bones…”
“Don’t finish it,” Bentley whispered, his eyes sad. “You are stronger than this, Candice|The tunnel widened out into a narrow room, and along one wall was a line of metal cages. Inside those cages were three women and two children.

"Please," said one of the women at the far end of the room. "Get us out of here."

Iain turned to Nicholas and barked, "Watch my back."

"Don't take long," said Nicholas|'Don't have one any more Mistress Weatherwax!' Granny followed his gaze. 'Oh deary, deary me,' she said. 'Well, I can see we shall have to do something about that. Look at me, Walter.' He did as he was told. Granny's eyes half-closed. 'You... trust Perdita, don't you, Walter|“Dios mio, partner,” said Goodspeed.  “Looks like you’re in a...sticky situation.  But I’m here to get you out of this taco of a pickle, si?”
“By throwing them a box of donuts?” Duke asked.
“By throwing them a box of donuts, yes,” said Goodspeed|I got offered a faculty position two years ago, and that was when I finally proposed to Colette.”
Ana looked into Vo’s eyes; they were dark and sad, like a storm of tears might just pour down at any minute, but she could see not a single drop.
“She planned the whole wedding,” said Vo|About fifty soldiers on fliers joined them, and there were several mice traveling as well. "Are the mice coming to fight?" Gregor asked Vikus.

"Not these. They have a special purpose. The rats are still receiving information from their spies in the area. We have chosen four lines of communication to sabotage. We will disable a rat who transmits the code, replace it with a nibbler, and feed false information to the rats," said Vikus|So he returned to his old haunt the Burger King for a breakfast and a read of the local newspaper and to decide what to do for the rest of the day. Jane’s pretty little face greeted him as he ordered a breakfast. This time she was not nervous, so Brad assumed that the boss had not turned up for work yet. "Boss not at work yet" asked Brad. "No he’s taken the day off," said Jane|Dani supposed that made sense, and asked, "But otherwise you don't die or age?"

Decker shook his head.

"And your sister is one hundred and thirty-seven?"

"Thereabouts," he agreed.

"And she's younger than you?"

Decker seemed to realize where her questions were leading. Lips twisting wryly he said, "I'm two hundred and fifty-nine years old, Dani|The bell rang right on cue.
All the students rushed to get out of the classroom, but Sofia came to talk to Ivan. She held out a hand and said, “I am Sofia, the class president. It’s nice to meet you.”
Ivan was stunned for a few seconds, as he was not expecting to be greeted by a girl as pretty as Sofia|It's passed on at death. There will always be a Strider of Chronos to fight you, and one of them will take you out."
Inferna threw back her head and laughed.
Carda tilted the medallion toward Rayne's purple crystal, and fired every last drop of his magic. Lightning exploded from the medallion in purple and gold spirals, and struck the crystal|“Do you realize,” said Roth, and not for the first time since it had become clear to him that she would more than likely be found guilty, “that the death penalty might be sought, and sentenced, if you’re found guilty?”
“Shades of Bruno,” said Ruth.
“It’s not a joke,” said Melissa from the door.
“Not meant as one,” said Ruth.
“Inciting to civil unrest, especially on this scale,” began Roth, in a new attempt to reason with Ruth|“You'll be sequestered for several weeks without any contact with the outside world,” Rousseau said.  This explanation did not relieve Patrick of the sensation that Veronique was lost to him, however.  
As he considered the possibility, Rousseau mistook his hesitation as concern.  “I'll be keeping a watch on her,” he told Patrick|Liam Hale tried desperately not to smile as he eyed the fierce look on Regan's face and reached for the soy sauce in the middle of the low, round table that was practically groaning from the weight of the massive spread of Chinese food. It was his night to pick what they had for dinner. He had called for Chinese to be delivered to his house because he had been working late. Maybe he had gotten a little carried away while he was ordering|Monk knelt at the entrance and shone his light inside. "Looks like there's enough room to climb into it."

"Is it a tunnel?" Jada asked.

Duncan searched up the cliff. "If so, it would've once been a sea tunnel," he clarified. "When this lake was full, this entrance would have been underwater|“Are you sure you know the way? We’ve only walked it once,” said Carley, starting to stand up too.
“Yeah, I’ll be fine. It’s just a couple of streets and I’ll be right back,” I said.
“Okay, I guess,” said Carley|I pushed the eggs a few inches away from me and then folded my arms.

Jamie frowned. "Fine," he said, and shoved his own bowl across the counter. "You don't eat, I don't eat." His stomach grumbled audibly. He folded his arms across his chest.

We stared at each other for two long minutes, both our stomachs rumbling as we inhaled the smell of the eggs|Both of the girls started to laugh and a third girl approached them, one more thin and shy then them, having her hair sand blonde, long until de hips, like Angell’s. She had brown eyes like a child.
“Lania, I told you to be here half an hour ago, to wait together for Angell to come. But seems to be that…” Serena started but Lania ended.
“Just give me a break, will you Serena|‘A small orchestra, perhaps,’ murmured Hawker, waving his pipe like a conductor. ‘Sherlock Holmes once discovered a Stradivarius worth over three hundred guineas in a pawnbroker’s shop on the Tottenham Court Road. He paid fifty-five shillings for it.’
‘What’s a Stradivarius, sir?’
‘A violin.’
‘Well, there’s no shortage of violins|"Thanks a lot man," Landon growled and pushed past us all, playfully dragging Jessi toward the house. "We are going in to get some grub. I'm not sticking around you and taking a chance on you making me look bad in front of my girl anymore."

"Brother, you don't have to have me to do that," Kane yelled, earning him a middle finger from Landon as he disappeared into the house with Jessi|The staircase was empty.

She hurried down the boardwalk which ended at a spiral staircase made of wood. At the bottom of the stairs, the giant balloons came into view. There were five monks there on the lower platform, waiting for her, waving to her. At the sight of her, two of the monks jumped into the first balloon, released a rope, and pushed away from the platform|‘And no one came back? No one came looking for – for a switch?’
Emma seemed taken aback.
‘You know about the switch?’
She stared curiously at both Chrissy and Si. They both nodded: Yes, they knew of the switch.
‘But…but Dad said even I wasn’t supposed to know about the switch|"Munchkins on deck."

Automatically Chance looked down, checking out the floor, but he didn't see either of the twins. "Where?"

Zane leaned back in his chair a little, looking around for his offspring. Spotting them, he said, "Under the desk. When they heard me let you in, they hid|It’s not a very big one, I’m afraid.”
“That’s okay.” Claire drained the last of her coffee and walked back into the apartment. She could feel Conor’s eyes on her as she left. When she reached the door she stopped and turned. Forcing herself to speak before her head overruled her desire, Claire gave an arch smile and called back to Conor|Colonel Patterson had been following Professor Martin's work for a long time. Derek already knew that, as they had met several times before in the lead up to funding being agreed, and up until now the U.S. military, via Colonel Patterson, was the chief source of their funding.
What Derek hadn't realised was exactly why they were being funded|He was still reeling from losing the connection with the boy. A few more seconds and they would have been joined. His power along with the boy’s control over the Amulet of Rhol would have made things much simpler. They...he would have been unstoppable. The boy was still not out of his reach. Solharn was confident that he was getting to the boy|I really didn’t want everyone to know about it.”
“How do you go from ‘I love you’ to ‘it was a mistake’ in twelve hours?”
“Lauren, you know what last night was about.”
“I didn’t say it, you did.”
“I didn’t mean it... you know that, Lauren|I’m Logan, Holt’s younger, more charming brother. Come in and I’ll get him.”
He almost yanked me into the entryway. I was glad I’d been there before, because otherwise I would have been really intimidated. 
Logan didn’t stand on ceremony. He cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled, “Holt|I realize that this probably isn’t the best time but I want to hear Nikolai’s explanations, and to be honest I’m exhausted and I could use a little rest, which Nikolai’s tale will give us, before we go any further.”
“Of course your…” Tares caught himself in time, “Slade.  We will listen to what the necromancer has to say if such is your wish.”
“I do wish.  Now Nikolai, you better start talking.”  Nikolai could see that whatever tentative trust had been building between Slade and himself had been partially eroded, thanks to Tares|We're trying to see what we can find out about the ring and its owner."
Carol still hesitated for a moment before she put it on, trying her little finger first and, when she found it very loose, transferring it to her third finger. Manjy, Frank and Alicia all waited, half expecting another story: it was with the greatest difficulty that she kept up the pretence of an experiment on the size of the ring|Harnesses wove their way across his body as he repositioned the four engines around the Umbra, watching them swing around on their electric tethers and rotate. He eased the ship upward with his fingers inside the light panel, controlling the individual thrust of each engine, making minute adjustments based on the haptic feedback. Tight blue energy spiraled from each of the four engines|Archie didn't get too many opportunities to talk privately with Emmett, so he decided to make use of this one. "You can tell me to mind my own business, but I can't help wondering. Have you ever thought of remarrying?"

"Nope." Emmett kept shoveling.

"Sorry if that was too personal."

"It wasn't." Emmett propped the shovel on the porch floor and leaned on it while he looked over at Archie|‘I certainly didn’t hear it, sir.’ 
‘Since when did Scotland Yard inspectors start behaving like acrobats in a circus?’
‘I wasn’t aware that they had started doing so, sir.’ Hawker remained pokerfaced, arms folded.
‘Then what is the purpose of this performance?’
‘This, sir, is not a performance|“I wouldn’t say that,” Rory countered. If I didn’t know better, I might say he was flirting. “There isn’t anything plain about you, Addie.” He studied me as if he’d never really looked at me before.
Trying to ignore the woozy giddiness that his gaze caused, I argued, “I know I’m plain|Right now, I want to talk about how we are going to attract the attention of those Deschanel boys coming to live next door.”
I laugh. “Are we still in kindergarten that we should have boyfriends living next door?”
“My gut tells me, they shall be good-looking. If not, they should at least be well-mannered.”
“Rich, powerful boys don’t do manners|“You have nothing to be sorry for,” replied Matilda. “I must say I was prepared for rudeness given the situation here at the moment but that was way over the top.”
“Yes,” agreed Jia, “but I will make it up to you, I promise.”
“Well, there is something I've noticed that you can explain to me,” said Matilda|First, you carry yourself like some penniless wanderer, then you tell me you're a businessman, and now this. So what are you going to tell me this time? That you've always had a passion for teaching?"

He gave a guilty grin. "I can't say it was a passion for teaching that brought me here. Passion, yes, but for something other than teaching|Several moments passed and then a little face peaked over the top of the log, a face with a pair of the most stunningly beautiful eyes she had ever seen. They looked at Leanne in awe, the intense turquoise orbes catching the shafts of sunlight that fell on the little girl’s face.
“Hello there ... what’s your name?” Leanne said, taking a step towards the shy figure that watched her from behind the log|Addressing Callahan, but it was Jones who answered.
“Lara Matthews. An associate of mine. I would have handled it, but, as you can see, I am here.”
She did not smile at the joke. “And your associate…?”
“She’s quite competent,” said Jones|My hands clamped around her hands just as she flexed her muscles to bring it down.

"Giguhl," I grunted, struggling against Porcia's straining muscles. "Help Adam!"

I kicked with the toes of my boots against the back of Porcia's legs, trying desperately to break her grip on the sword. A blur of green in my peripheral vision told me Giguhl had gone to check on Adam|Spill the beans. He’s on the line with Adams right now.”
“Alright. Are you sitting for this one?”
Jimmy leaned against a wall, knowing his friend Brad wouldn’t exaggerate any news he had. “Give it to me.”
“It was a hit and run, Jimmy|Chrissy was fully aware, however, that in the blink of an eye, the tripping of a small, red switch, she might suddenly cease to exist. Si could see that awareness, that awful dilemma that her own end might be near, on her strained face.
What would she decide? he wondered.
Steeping closer towards him, Chrissy moved his hand away from the switch|'I used to get arrested on an average of once a week. They never would throw me in the dungeon, though, no matter what kind of names I called my father. I tried very hard to get thrown into the dungeon, but the police wouldn't cooperate.'

'Why on earth did you want to spend time in a dungeon|Then he lowered his voice until it was just a rumble of sound. "Good to see you again. Miss me?"

"No." Yes. He'd stayed away from her for three days. No doubt he'd done it deliberately to drive her nuts. Well, it wasn't working! Oh, she told herself, of course it was working|"We do not need his help," said Solovet dismissively.

"You don't think you need anyone's help. It would serve you right if we all left you here to rot in the jungle, Solovet," said Lapblood.

"Go, then. Return to your caves. We will find the cure without you," said Solovet|he asked as Thomas appeared behind the square leading two horses by the reins. 
“Yes,” she said, then turned back to her parents. “Thank you for everything,” she said. She reached for her mother’s hand and gave it a quick squeeze before turning to Anna and pulling her into a tight embrace. 
“I’ll be looking for you in a month’s time,” whispered Anna|Not because she was the school gossip (even though she was), but because, from that point forward, almost everything about my life was on a need-to-know basis and, right then, Tina didn't. No matter how much she probably thought otherwise.

"So..." Tina asked slowly. "What's the deal?"

"I don't have a clue, Tina|Ari braced herself. I need you to take me to Azazil.

Glass gave her a sharp, curious look but unlike Red, he didn't question her. All right. Now?

Please.

Very well. He looked back at Trey and touched his cheek tenderly. Whatever passed between them caused Trey to glower and he turned to Ari|Elise and Miranda walked to the table and as Elise took a seat, gathering herself, Miranda went to the cabinet above the stove and pulled out a pill box. Dropping two white pills into her palm, she took them over to Elise who happily accepted them as Miranda got her a glass of water.
“I knew I shouldn’t have gone out, but I went to get you something…” Miranda drew a glass of water and marched it over to Elise|Slowly, the twinkle that normally lit Clay's eyes returned and Hardy grinned, offering his fist for a bump. "Nice!"

Clay playfully tapped his knuckles against Hardy's. "I can't help it if they want me."

"Oh-ho-ho! He's a play-ah!"

Clay's cheeks pinked up and he smiled back at Hardy|You’re a Traveler and Travelers don’t know about those things.”
“I’m a what? I’m a Traveler?”
“Of course you are. You’re a Traveler just as I am a Wanderer. Surely you know that, after all you followed me here didn’t you?”
“I know you’re a Wanderer, but I never knew I was a Traveler|Something told me that this was the same voice which informed me of the next songs to come on the radio station before they aired. It was the voice which told me with unshakeable certainty I would be getting the job. I knew better than to argue with this voice. This voice was not that of reason but of psychic intuition.
Yet, I didn’t think of myself as a psychic|Pierce didn't talk a lot, and he always seemed the coldest of the group-aside

from Morgead, of course, who could be colder than anyone. Now Jez wondered. Could he, who never

seemed to be moved by pity, actually be the most sensitive?

"I'm worried about this fire. I know nobody can look down on us, but it's making a lot of smoke|It seemed that Owen knew her more than I did.
“Keep an eye out for her,” I said, adding, “for her sake.” Owen glanced at me, eyes slightly narrowed before nodding. I bit my lip, feeling guilty Mel had gotten so upset with him. If anyone should have faced her anger, it should have been me, not Owen|This time I hold the sweatshirt up to my nose and breathe deeply.

Rain
I get the kids off to school and call Wren at the store.  It is only ten minutes after 8 o’clock, but I can’t wait another second.  The phone rings until the machine picks up.
“No I don’t want to leave a message for Moonstars,” I yell at the beep, “I want to talk to Wren|Charlotte rolled her eyes.

"He's not bad-looking," I went on. "And he's filthy rich too-if he's telling the truth about his family. It's just his habit of raising a perfumed lace hanky to his nose that doesn't exactly make me swoon."

"What a shame there's no one but you to admire him," said Charlotte|She’d been swimming, kayaking and just hanging out here with friends for years.  It was a piece of Paradise…
She met Scott at the harbor parking area.  They’d both dragged brightly colored kayaks off the tops of their cars and were hauling them down to the beach to put in.
“That’s the sorriest wetsuit I’ve ever seen,” said Scott|Julian began the ritual healing chant, and from several miles away, the rest of the Carpathians, linked as they were with their unique telepathy, joined in. All of them felt Darius's weakness and pain. All of them knew he would not go to ground as he needed.

Tempest pushed herself from the driver's seat and staggered down the trailer until she could drop to her knees beside Darius. "Is he going to be okay, Julian|He paused without turning around.

"You ..." Fin paused, suddenly hesitant, and licked her lips. "You're still moving in aren't you?"

Turning, Ryan grinned crookedly, but it didn't wipe the sadness from his eyes. "Of course. Everything I've ever said to you has been the truth, Fin|He still shook his head. "Eight hours of waiting, though long, wouldn't cause you to be so exhausted you'd faint. Not without an underlying cause."

"I've been here since 4:00 a.m..." His eyebrows shot up in surprise. And that was before she added, "yesterday|The minute I saw that balcony, I knew I was going to find a way to f**k Liz out there while looking out over the ocean. "This is so beautiful." I dropped the bags to the ground, walking out to the balcony behind her.

"It is," I agreed, pulling her back to my front. Leaning over her, my face went into her neck, smelling the scent of her hair mixed with the ocean|Haleton jumped back from the other building, landing by her side.
The lift door opened. Amber rushed into the lift, quickly pressing the ground floor button.
“I can’t allow you to leave until I’ve finished my explanation,” said Haleton preventing the door from closing.
“I’m warning you, stay away from me,” yelled Amber, pushing her back into the wall of the lift|“Knowing full well,” she went on, ignoring Gabriel’s interjection, “that for our esteemed brother, that was pretty much the same as a personal challenge.”
“It could not be done,” protested Gabriel.
“Calling his competence into question, that’s what you did. That’s goading. At least when it comes to Netoniel.”
“It was a stupid idea,” said Gabriel|Well, he was in for a surprise, then, because if Julian ended up sitting on the floor handcuffed to a table leg or safe or mini refrigerator, then Cameron would be sitting right there next to him.

Cameron mulled over what Ty had said, and the unusual discomfort of the situation, until the door to the room opened and Julian walked in. He still appeared calm and stoic, but Cameron recognized the tension in his shoulders. As soon as he saw Cameron, though, he relaxed|A sudden movement flashed in front of the truck. Gabe hit the brakes as they slammed into a large object. A broad antler flew across the hood of the truck, and it’s tip burst through the windshield. Alyssa screamed as the truck lurched over the large animal and came to a sliding stop. Samantha flew off the bench and rolled onto the floor beside Alyssa|My arms felt as if they might pop out of their sockets when I squeezed the clamp and slammed to an almost instantaneous stop. I was dangling from the cable, looking down into the cavernous space of Sublevel Two.

"I can't believe that worked," I admitted, breathless.

"Cam!" Bex shouted, stopping me before I could release my hold on the cable|Brandon looked on, almost in shock, as the worker lifted both the sickle and chain high over his head. 
“Look. I’m The Mangler!” the worker said, as he laughed out loud. 
The light from the sun reflected off the sickle's blade and shined right into Brandon’s horrified eyes. The worker turned his head and looked right at Brandon|Excitement had buzzed through them all in that moment, all three of them leaning in towards the old man together. "So?" she had asked. "Will they? Will they take it away?"

Disappointingly the Prophet had merely shrugged. "They're still deliberating."

"What do you mean they're still deliberating|Many feet of it. Their scent was getting fainter. And that's when the serpent hit my nose and everything went dark," said Twitchtip.

"You think...they were pulled under, then?" said Howard.

"I don't know for sure. But that would be my guess, if I were forced to make one," said Twitchtip|He continued to follow the perps trail on the monitors, until he lost him when he ran behind a dumpster.  He appeared to be injured.  The tapping on the house had stopped by this point.
“Can you see where the shots are coming from?” Christian yelled to Vasquez.
“No, I’m not sure.  I didn’t see them go down,” said Vasquez|Sophia pointed a finely manicured hand and the corpses burst into vibrant ebony flames, consuming the carcasses in seconds.
Tomas let out a raspy shriek of rage, his scrawny frame shaking violently. Raising his claw-like hands yet again, he gestured frantically, shouting his incantation. On either side of the necromancer, the rotted floorboards erupted in a shower of dirt and splinters|All three different in her own way and style, but they all seemed to complement each other. 
“Alright, spill.  Who’s the hunk and why was he looking at you as though he wants to devour you whole?” Joy asked with a giggle and brought Beth out of her private thoughts.
Lynn looked confused and said, “What hunk|The only other person he'd waited for was Sophia, and now she was his. He was going to do everything in his power to keep her. Edward was sure of one thing, and that was his love for Sophia.

He hoped by the end of the day he was back to calling himself Nash. Edward was such a pu**y f**king name|“Amazing,” she says. “Great work, Rahda.” Cat briefly squeezes my hand, her eyes bright, then, before she enters The Gardens’ secret door, she gives Roland a knowing look. He nods at her, and Cat disappears.
I watch her go and then turn my attention to Roland|When she pulled up to her apartment and parked, the tears flowed. She couldn’t help it. She liked Pete but couldn’t date him, and loathed Charles but had to date him. Both of them were pressuring her to give them things she couldn’t give. She didn’t wish to hurt Pete, but she couldn’t simply walk away from Charles|“A few of my boys tell me they see you going up to the slopes every morning at two-thirty. You got something going on up there?”
“Exercise,” Blake said, already feeling a rattling cough trying to claw its way out of his chest.
The men around him laughed.
“Get him,” Elkin said. “Guy can barely breathe, and he’s going to exercise|Jenna smiled and winked at her before wobbling out of the restroom. Tracy followed her, watching the girl sashay out. She watched her h*ps sway from side to side and decided that this was going to be a fun experience.

▪▪▪

"Well ladies? Another shot?" Mr. Hayes asked holding up what was left of the bottle|Make sure he uses it to pay the bills." Shirley's light footsteps come closer to the bed and she rests a hand on my shoulder. I keep my eyes on Mom, terrified if I glance away she'll disappear.

"Two days ago your mom told me a funny story. It was the type that could start with once upon a time," says Shirley|But it's too suspicious that Scarlett would just happen to know where you were last night after the accident. This appears to be the proof we've been looking for all along."

"It's the principal," Cassie shouted. "I can feel it in my bones."

Adam responded to Cassie softly, guardedly. "We haven't been able to dig up a single suspicious thing on the new principal|Rose opened her mouth to ask her something, but Mick interrupted. “I suppose you ladies have the festivities for Friday all planned out. I suppose you have a big cake and flowers and the whole nine yards. Do ya?”
“Nothing like that,” Violet told him. “Rita will make a cake, but it won’t be big|“Hey, little girl,” he said, creeping around the counter toward her. Arielle tensed but didn’t turn away. She gripped the handle of the skillet, which was burning hot by now. 
Elkin placed his damp, bony hands around her waist and pressed up against her backside. “No need to be so cold to me, Arielle|"Nothing so simple, dear Rayne. The crystal is my pledgestone. It's what transfers my powers to Demetrius." She lowered her chin and gazed at Rayne through long eyelashes. "But now you have it."
Rayne's heart thudded and heat burned his face. He opened his hand and looked at the crystal|Skye imagined running, hiding, maybe relocating closer to her stepfather. But if Burke was truly bent on finding her, he'd be able to do so sooner or later because she refused to cut all ties with the people and places she loved, refused to let him cost her any more than he already had. Besides, she didn't feel that close to her stepfather|I am slightly hurt, but somehow not shocked at all to hear this. "It's a tooth."
"A tooth? From..."
"Yep. That's pretty much all that's left after all this time. That and a few scraps of cloth. That is what your father keeps hidden."
"Can they do the ritual with just a tooth|And as she kisses him, she knows she's kissing the lips of a stranger as well. How can his music be so in tune with her soul and the rest of him so disconnected? So out of joint? She should never have allowed this to happen, but she can't let go of his ill-gotten hands. And she finds it almost as hard to break away from the kiss|"What is it, mamma?" Selena uttered, just as the youngest, Eliza, flew into the foyer. Eliza had been napping on the window seat when she ought to have been attending to her penmanship, and her face was aglow with slumber and guilt.
"Yes, what is it, mamma|"Thank you, John, for that very interesting report on Blake Guv," said the lead reporter.  "And now for the most unusual twist in our story of the governor's race.  It has just been announced that an anonymous donor has created an unlimited trust fund to be used as the campaign fund for one of today's last minute filers!  Two million dollars has already been placed in the fund|“But there is no sink…” argued Sharianna, as Joseph reached out and put his hand under the pipe.
Water suddenly gushed out onto his hand and he jerked it back in time for everyone to see the water miraculously “flow” through mid air and disappear into the wall below the faucet.
“Whoa,” said Joseph softly.  “I guess you don’t need a sink|Julia leafed through the book, rejecting playbills, newspaper articles, and faded letters until she came to a page with a few photographs tipped with black paper corners. In one, a young black man leaned against the door of a truck. He was relaxed, robust, and smiling for the camera. “That was Billy,” said Julia.
“Yes. That’s the first thing I need to know, Julia|“There is...something down there.  I’m not sure what.  I haven’t got too close.  I was too frightened, if you must know.  I mean I’m brave but I’m not stupid.”
“Well I must continue on with my investigation.  Now if you don’t mind...”
“What investigation|He defeated enemy after enemy - you see, he distracted the Dark Oculators so much that they couldn't concentrate hard enough to work their Lenses!"

Sing sighed. "Thinking about those kinds of Talents always makes tripping seem so bland."

"Breaking things isn't all that great either," I said.

"No, Alcatraz. Breaking things - now that's a real Talent|Then it struck them. “Except for Tayanna!” they exclaimed in unison.
“She complained of a headache and went to the apothecary,” said Matilda.
“We can easily check that out,” offered Zinzabad. “Let's go there and ask.”
So, holding Zinzabad's hand, Matilda went out to the entrance hall and asked a guard for directions to the apothecary|Chloe laughed and was about to deny any part in the state of Fenris's mood, when he pushed into her mind. "We shall be met at the longhouse. I would have my grooming attended to."

Chloe's eyes narrowed at the women in the lake. Was there some kind of family version of wolf telepathy she didn't know about? "Um ... hi," she mind-spoke back to Fenris|Henric didn’t say a word, he just picked up the landline phone and the cell phone, did the security system switchy thing, and talked to someone about the need.  This took twenty seconds.  He hung up, did not look at Jinny, went back to work.  Jinny cooled his heels.  Half an hour later, the cell phone rang.  Henric said GO, listened, put the phone down, and nodded at Jinny|Dust and debris fill the air as the boulders fall, blocking the entrance. She staggers back, surveying the results. Yes, it will do, the opening is no longer evident.
“Can thou transport us as close to where we left the last batch of eggs as possible?”
Belnarth does not answer, but in the next breath they stand in the warm cavern beside the pile of eggs|You hate bullies, and you always watch out for Jeffrey at school. I seriously doubt an evil person would care about him. I know you love Nate, and it’s easy to see how much you loved your father. I don’t think an evil person can love like that. And you’re so good with animals. Uncle Brendan says animals can sense when someone is bad, so there is no way they’d let you near them if you were evil|Filled to bursting with ravenous wolves, eyes shining eerily in the dark.
When the footage was done, it switched to an anchorman who looked appropriately serious.
“Is this proof that werewolves exist or just a clever parlor trick? This video, shot by an unnamed source, has gone viral literally overnight. Experts have yet to be able to debunk the footage and in just a matter of days, millions of people from all over the world have begun to flood the area in hopes of either proving or disproving the presence of werewolves|He glanced behind him, but he was alone in the room. McDougal was speaking through the crystal-clear speakers positioned in every corner.

"Connor Bruce," he replied, imagining what the man looked like who went with that voice. It sounded almost as if he was on a respirator.

"Should I know you, Mr. Bruce|“Don’t,” said Duke.  “I’m starting to like this show.” 

DON’T TOUCH THAT DIAL...



	


Part 12: Take My License, All That Jive
“I really think it would be easier if you pulled over,” said Doctor Coplawyer.
“There’s no time,” said Duke|He described his visit to Sophia's grave and told her about the closure he had managed to find. "After the funeral, I felt there were things you and I had to say to each other, but never did. We just walked away from each other."

Randi stared at him. "I know what you mean. But back then, a part of me still blamed you for what had happened to Sophia|But still he dared to ask, “And each drop has to waken from within?”
“Yes.”
“How many universes are there?”
“Many.”
“We will never be done,” said Ananda, his voice broken by despair.
The Buddha smiled. “Never is a very long time, Ananda|"We have to take a train to the docks," Lashonda said, not pausing to look at him.  "And the ferry to Friedan Isle only leaves three times a day.  If we don't catch the first ferry, we'll miss our appointment.  I told you that last night."
"Yes, but why do we have to go to Friedan Isle|"Harrison and I will meet you at the baggage claim."

"Like a lost sock."

"Oh, honey," Mom jokes. "You're more like a whole suitcase. And you're not lost."

Hadley's voice is very small. "What if I am?"

"Then it's just a matter of time before you get found|The box appeared seamless when he first examined it, except of course for those seams that one would expect to find in a wooden box, those where the wood was glued together.  There were no hinges because the box did not have the kind of lid he’d been looking for.  Instead, it consisted of two separate pieces, one inside the other.  As he pulled the key out, the entire front side slid outward from the rest of the box|“Oh yeah, you guys rescued that little doggie and he totally didn’t get mad about it.  Even when it bit him in the backyard.”
“Yeah, he’s a real idiot,” said Mona.
“Oh no, he’s a nice old guy,” said Tiffany.
“Better than my creepy landlord,” said Mona|You know that I, as a Senator's daughter, cannot go to Egypt any more than can a Senator. I would so love -"

"Why is that, Madam?" asked the Legate.

"She's lying to you!" roared Lucius. "Her whole family was murdered."

'Very simple reason, Tribune," I said to the Legate|If anyone had told me a month ago that I would ever walk past those gates, up that hill, and set foot anywhere on the grounds of Ravenwood, I would've said they were crazy. In a town like Gatlin, where you can see everything coming, I wouldn't have seen this. Last time, I had only made it as far as the gates|I knelt down next to him. "Are you okay?"

"I'm fine." He sat up as though nothing had happened. His wings still extended from his back. Long, black, beautiful wings that I wanted to touch. I was losing my mind. I was locked in a cell, and I was thinking about touching a guy's wings|He could do nothing to shake the numbers from his thoughts. While the clock counted down to zero the numbers increased in size and intensity. They started small but quickly grew to big bold numbers the colour of the midnight hour. Inside a minute the numbers were the size of a house. He couldn’t stop his mind being fixated on the black numbers|"And, as you can probably imagine," he goes on, "since Michelle and my mom are in town, there's a lot more than just the baby shower gifts waiting for you when you get home."

* * *

The next day, when Andrew opens the front door of our house and I walk in with Lily in my arms, I see right away that he was right about that, too. The house is immaculate. I never could've cleaned it like this myself|She had been holding her breath without realizing it.
	“Dizzy,” Travis said. “What are you doing?”
	The Cast Member shrugged his shoulders and motioned to the man driving the raft to depart. He replaced the rope fencing and the raft began the short trip to Tom Sawyer’s Island. Megan looked back at Dizzy, confused why they didn’t get on the raft|Not hard if you read between the lines of my song lyrics.

"You can take it," he said in a quiet voice.

"What makes you so sure? I mean, have you met me lately?"

Jed frowned slightly. "I know it's been rough. But I also know that you're strong|Even with her head under the water, Surreal heard Kartane scream.

She popped up out of the water, then immediately lowered herself to her neck. The pool, fed by a hot spring, was delightfully warm, but the air was cool enough to bite.

She heard snarls, a howl, a terrified shriek.

The air wasn't the only thing around there that had a bite|She couldn't just come out and say it. This was something that probably needed a bit of an explanation.

But if she explained, then he might explain why he'd left her that weekend to marry the other woman. She really didn't want to hear his explanations. She couldn't imagine any reason she'd like that would excuse that kind of a betrayal|"Even though Samson and the others kids still died yesterday?" I asked.

The band geek shrugged. He didn't have an answer for that anymore than I did.

I sighed and stabbed my fork into the delicate china bowl on the table in front of me. I wasn't sure exactly what was in the bowl|All these questions circle around in my brain creating a tornado so strong I'm surprised the National Tornado Center doesn't issue an all-points bulletin.

Yes, I'm going that crazy.

Today is a gym day so we didn't jog this morning. Oh, and it also happens to be my weigh in day too. It's weird because I'm not even nervous|"What?"

"You heard me," Mykolas answered patiently as he swiftly disposed of the ruler and put his engorged c**k back into his pants.

"Maybe you measured it wrong?"

"Velvet."

Eleven point five. Surely that was an exaggeration? But...Mykolas didn't seem to be the type to exaggerate|“Sure,” said Rick, “that would be nice.”
George led them to the opposite corner of the warehouse where there was a large door, identical to the one they’d driven through.  Shoulder high, next to the door was a large grey button.  George hit it with the palm of his hand, and the door rolled up letting the sunshine fill that part of the warehouse|"After we get the transmitter we go right back to the car and we leave Paradise immediately," Six says. "Right?"

"Right," I say.

"We don't make contact with anyone else; we just go. We leave."

I know she's referring to Sarah, and I bite my lip. Finally after all these weeks on the run, I'm back in Paradise and I'm told I can't see Sarah|Malin suddenly caught himself, glanced at Basil, who had allowed no expressions other than polite interest to cross his face, then plunged recklessly on. “I caught images of some black troll-like figures from the mind of the guercat. She said something drove her and her kittens to Godsel. What do you make of it all, Basil|"Well, yeah."

"Oh, that's a relief."

"But-"

"Look." She leaned into the window frame. "I'm not worried about STDs. Not with you. I suppose you probably should have some concerns about me. But I can promise you that, as far as I know, I'm clean|I scrub a hand down my face in embarrassment, but she's laughing. Take it easy, and don't overdo it, she instructs.

I nod as heat creeps up my face. Emily just smiles and shakes her head. Busted. This is why you don't sign in front of hearing people. Aside from the fact that it's just rude|Belgarath asked.

"He said that I'd recognize it when I came to it."

"Is that all he said about it?"

"He said that it was very important and that it was going to change me."

Belgarath shook his head. "Why does everything always have to be in riddles|'It is exactly eight feet off the ground. Now we shall make a table upon which this gentleman may eat his breakfast in comfort. Fetch me four very tall grandfather clocks. There are plenty of them around the Palace. Let each clock be twelve feet high.'

Sixteen footmen spread out around the Palace to find the clocks|They didn’t call it that, but as part of their public relations they are doing tours.  We could go and somehow slip away.”
I smiled at Jackie.  “Look at you.  You’re turning into a regular Nancy Drew.  But how are we going to sneak around without getting caught?”
“Your boyfriend has a cousin that works there,” replied Jackie|I couldn’t believe I’d ever thought I loved him.
	“I want us to work things out,” he pleaded.  “I want us back together.  I won’t give you a divorce.”
	I just smiled.  This wasn’t the 1800’s.  He didn’t have the option of not giving me a divorce|Officer Vasquez introduced Katrina to the Captain.
“Let me see the message,” said Johns reaching for her cell phone.  Katrina handed it to him. Johns and Christian both read the message.
“What makes you think that message is from the perp?” asked Captain Weatherspoon.
“He signed it “The Guardian,” replied Katrina|The aid-worker with the needle pauses, giving me a nervous look. Then, in shaky English, replies, "He says your friend looks like pale hippo."

Ivan takes a step towards the boy, but I stop him with a hand on his shoulder.

"The boy's right," I tell the aid-worker, "he does look like a hippo|"It's like chocolate-covered fruit."

"Exactly," I said, cracking an MandM's between my teeth.

"Do you want anything else to eat? I should have offered." He walked into the kitchen with Napoleon and looked in the fridge. "I don't have much, because, as you know, I can't cook|Gill was now sounding rather upset.
"Gill seems to believe her story," said Manjy.
"I don't know what we can do to prove anything about either story, whatever we think the experience was," said Frank.
Steve was very thoughtful. "There is one thing that would help us know how we stood with the first story|“You’re in hospital. In England. I was on the RAF Hercules that brought you here.”
A vague memory stirred in Dusty’s spinning head.
“I’m Annie. Annie Mackie. We found you in Switzerland, and brought you home.”
Dusty frowned.
“I was with Commander Nick Marsden, but don’t try to remember everything now,” said Annie|And if it's wrong to want all of those millions of cheerleaders to rub all of their millions of pom-poms on my nak*d chest, well, then I don't want to be right, Duke. I don't want to be right."

"You're such a clown," she said. "And such a genius."

I fell behind them again but trudged along, not much of a clown and not much of a genius|Silas knew what Bishop Aringarosa would call it.

Divine intervention.

"I had wanted to free you earlier," the servant apologized," but it was impossible. With the police arriving at Chateau Villette, and then at Biggin Hill airport, this was the first possible moment. You understand, don't you, Silas|I just want to have proof that I delivered it in case someone asks."
The nurse smiled and took the delivery scrip.  "Sure." She pawed around her desk for an ink pen but only found pencils.  Shrugging, she used the gold fountain pen and signed her name.  "That's funny," she said, shaking it, "no ink|"We're going to take her now."

Lucas frowned but let go of her hand.

Kylie refused to be wheeled into the lab where the scan would take place. She wasn't sick. But she did make sure her gown was tied before giving everyone a peek at her pink bikini underwear.

Holiday squeezed her hand before she walked into the lab|Jacob reached out to the waist-high edge of the fountain and steadied himself.
“Did either of you even try to land or did we just arrive here?” he asked.
“I was going too fast to land,” Kaya said, steadying herself against the fountain.
“I agree with Kaya,” Andrew said, turning to Jacob|He offered his hand to Lystus, interjecting between Lystus and the young woman. "Wing dust," he whispered.
The boy didn't hear and the effect of this reinforced apothos was subtle, adding to the tension and warmth in Alcander's chest and the region behind his eyes. Lystus smiled now and met Alcander's gaze.
"It's a pleasure to meet you, Promander," said Lystus|“He didn’t let you die.” Banshee takes a deep breath and looks back at Becca. “You’ll be alone one day. All alone. And he won’t be there to protect you.” He laughs hysterically and backs up a bit. 
“What are you talking about, Banshee|"There you are," she said, holding Paul's hand. "And you must be Hannah." Renee barely even looked at Hannah's scars. I'd expected that; nothing phased Renee, least of all something like a scar.

"I must be," Hannah said, shrugging. "I'm going to take a wild guess and say you're Renee|As such, the Vuduri really don't have doctors. They have medics.  After all, people, even Vuduri, still suffer injuries. But doctors treating disease, no, this is no longer a viable profession.

We got our first hint of this when Rei met Canus on Dara in Rome's Revolution. Rei flat out asked Canus if he was a doctor and Canus told him flat out that no, he was more of a medic|"I thought tonight was going to be all business and no pleasure, but I can see that there is plenty of pleasure to be had. Thank you for coming, Violet."

Violet smiles prettily. "Thank you. And you are ... ?"

"Randall Gregory, but I'd love it if you called me Rand."

Violet nods. "It's nice to meet you, Rand|I rush into his arms and he enfolds me tightly. "Dad, what happened? How is she?" I can't breathe, demanding and fearful of the words I've been waiting hours to hear.

"There was an accident." His voice is hoarse, tight. He swal ows and I want to say I know that already|'That is a last souvenir from an old... friend,' said Ezio. 'But now I need one more piece of advice from you.'

Leonardo shrugged. 'If I can help you, I will.'

Ezio glanced over at Leonardo's assistants. 'Perhaps in private?'

'Follow me.'

Back in the studio, Ezio unwrapped the slip of paper Mario had given him and handed it to Leonardo|Joe interrupted.  “Tell us the truth, Jacob.  Tell us how you betrayed your brother and sister!” 
“I didn’t betray anyone!  You did!” 
Joe grew angrier than ever.  “And I never betrayed you!” 
“Oh, really??” 
“Just tell us what happened, Jacob|Night was coming and it got dark fast in this part of the country. After the homey meal, Mr. Walker announced that some of the cowboys would be playing on the outside yard, and anyone who felt like dancing should come outside.  Sarah was shy and not sure what she felt like doing. She followed other guests outside to enjoy the night air, but didn’t plan on dancing|"Where's Cole?"

"Getting some food. He thinks I need some." She took another sip and giggled.

"We were just thinking of getting some food, too."

Kimber looked past me to Sam. "Looking good."

Sam smiled. "How much punch have you had, Kimber|She yanked the doors open and ran to the wall of elevators in the shiny floored lobby, her sneakers squeaking ear piercingly on the tiles. She jabbed the button with a finger. Nothing happened. She jabbed it again. Out of the corner of her eye she could see shapes, people moving outside. And then she noticed the thin slot next to the button|It all added up to equal one major downer.

"We just have to fight," he finally said. "That's all we can do. Fight until we either win or die. Until Tick does whatever he's going to do. Maybe Rutger will find us some more people. But all we can do-me and you-is fight|“The room looks clean, Admiral,” Dex reported, scanning the readouts of the nanocomputer on his wrist. “My instruments don’t detect any listening devices, traps, or secret openings. You can go to sleep, sir. I’ll keep watch.”
“I don’t think that will be necessary, Dex|Robin closed her eyes, stuck out the mitt and was so shocked when she caught the ball that she toppled backward into the wet grass.

"You all right?" Jeff yelled, racing toward her.

"I'm fine, I'm fine," she shouted back, discounting his concern as she brushed the dampness from the seat of her jeans. She righted herself, assumed the position and waited for the second ball|Although the flames burned hot, he simply disappeared up the chimney. Another gasp of awe spread through the room.

"Savannah makes magic wherever she goes," Jacques agreed. "Those children will never forget this night."

Savannah waved her wand just as the footsteps overhead indicated St. Nick was climbing back into the sleigh. He swung his black boots expertly over the edging and picked up a long whip, cracking it over the head of the reindeer|“No he did not.” Beth stilled her head and looked up at her.
“Mrs. Reilly,” she began, then, “can I call you Beth?”
“Yes. Of course.”
“And you please call me Karen.”
“Sure. Karen.” 
 “But you have to listen to me, Beth|She took the hint and started regaling everyone with one of her famous stories about her sons’ antics when they were growing up.  Everyone sat around exchanging stories, while Det. Christian slept like the dead. 
An hour later det. Johns decided it was time to tell Katrina their theory.  
“There are something’s we need to discuss,” said det. Johns|He sniffed the air, as if he could detect the proximity of land.

Widowed?

'Look at that. Hardly worth going to sleep now. Here, Nicol, come and have a drink with me.'

Widowed? The word held a glorious resonance. He wanted to shout, 'She's a widow|When Kress had finished, she said only, "I ought to leave you there.''

Kress began to blubber. "You can't. Help me, I'll pay" "I ought to," Wo repeated, "but I won't."

"Thank you," Kress said. "Oh, thank-"

"Quiet," said Wo|"When you saw him, did you have the same uneasy feeling that you said you felt today on campus?"

Chloe's eyes widened as she considered the question. "Yes, it was exactly the same."

"Then maybe you have seen the man who's stalking you." Gray looked at his notes, then back at Chloe|Follow your heart, they had said.  His heart was confused, it seemed like everyone he had met so far had been healed through the infection and found whatever peaceful existence was right for them.  Hammond couldn't imagine what that must feel like.  Even now, he was still labeled as abnormal.  Then it struck him, in his heart, that all Hammond had ever wanted was to be normal|They had overheard Tyler’s dad, their flight instructor, in the office talking to a Forest Service pilot about how the wind had picked up. The Forest Service pilot asked about the solo flight. That’s when they heard Fitz say that Hardy Jacobs had the best instincts in the air of anyone he had ever taught. Chance had felt so jealous, and so had Tyler|Weldon Harper also receives reports, I'm sure. In fact, Hancock notified Wlodek through channels of the attempt in New Mexico. We received certain information from him that was quite helpful. Weldon Harper was also notified and had people on standby as well. Then there you were, Lissa. You were kept ignorant purposely because of your youth and the potential volatility of the situation, yet there you came, leaping right in the middle of things|It's one thing to adopt a litter together, but watching you have some other guy's litter?  That doesn't seem right.  Unless..."
Lashonda waited as the noise of the train filled Topher's silence.  Sometimes, if she waited long enough, he'd finish his thoughts.  He thought things through more slowly than she did.  She knew that, but it was hard to wait|I can't help wondering ... What do you want?' The buffalo holder absorbed this one for consideration, too. And it seemed to Rincewind that the slowness of the thought process wasn't due to native stupidity, but more to do with the sheer size of the question. He could feel it spreading out so that it incorporated the soil and the grass and the sun and headed on out into the universe|And a premonition crept into the hope in my throat.
From seemingly every corner of the palace, from behind every terraced wall, the leather wings of hines emerged, stretching like enormous batwings before the golden bricks of the palace. And on each hine was the black-robed figure of a Moreinen guard.
Audrey flew on as though the palace walls hadn’t become infinitely more difficult to penetrate|“Will you help me get out?” asked Colton, eager to get moving. He remembered Kamiko’s threat of what would happen to his friends if he escaped.
“As I was saying,” said Dormer. “You won’t get topside without a distraction.”
“Now is as good a time as any,” said Colton|Kylie asked, and in the corner of her vision, she spotted Derek frowning. No doubt, seeing her hold a conversation with a ghost would be unsettling. He ought to try having one and see how unsettling that could be.

Because you want to stay alive.

Kylie's breath caught and she looked at Derek|In the meantime, I’ll find some work for you to do to pay me back.”
Tom thought over the plan as he tore the roll apart.  The dog nudged his leg, so he quickly slipped a piece of it to him when no one was looking.  He quickly patted the dog’s head and chewed the other half of the roll|I’m sure of it.” Poppa laughed.
Momma twisted a dishtowel and looked a warning at Poppa.
“It’s love; it’s love.” Poppa sang as he trotted around the table.
Momma was hot on his heels, snapping the towel and telling him to behave.
When Momma and Poppa were winded from laughing and chasing, Annie, also laughing, said, “He’s right Momma|“Let me see that…” Sarah took the brochure from Abby and continued to read the inside and outside flap.  “This looks terrific…”
“Yeah, you’d be riding, roping and sleeping out under the stars.  All those things you’ve wanted to do.  Maybe you’ll meet a cute cowboy…”
Sarah swatted her with the brochure|"Adele," she stammered, unable to believe that this incredibly hot boy - the most desired stud on campus, if the rumors were to be believed - was speaking to her and not Goldie.

"We call her Adie," Goldie put in. "I'm Goldie." She held out her hand, refusing to be outdone.

Brian shook it, and then turned back to Adie|Hari asked, concealing the tension of his anticipation.

Chen called Hari forward to the docket with a waggle of his thin finger, and pointed to an informer tablet, on which an image of the world and its location were displayed. "It is called, I believe, Terminus," said Chen.

Hari glanced at it, breathless, and looked up at Chen|The shelf was massive, if it fell on us we would be trapped, pinned within this store and at the mercy of the monsters outside.

I became frozen as my terror over being trapped anywhere burst to hot, vivid life.

Aiden threw himself away from the shelf. He wrapped his arm around my waist as he dove forward. We fell to the floor in a tumbled heap; the breath was knocked out of me, my tailbone screamed in protest as we bounced away from the shelf|Nora resolved not to tell the band about the disturbances until she exhausted all other options.  But in the years she'd known them, she had gotten used to having their experiences and knowledge at hand.  Trying to research the mysterious creature in the woods by herself was a tedious process.  After the second time she and Corbin were followed in the woods she started to think there was more than one creature|At eighty-three years old, Fate had lived the longest of any Overseer ever. He warned Addy that moving the estate would take a toll since his health was bad, but she didn’t expect him to miss speaking to everyone. In her entire nineteen years being alive, he’d never missed addressing everyone after a move.
“Your grandfather will be fine,” Bernard said, nodding at Addy|* * * * *
“A satellite, surely,” Alexi Levitov said, pointing to a stream of light cascading toward the Anderson’s field. “But I haven’t heard of any in that state of decay.”
“No,” Adrian O’Donnell replied, watching the stream of light change direction, level out, and lightly touch down. “I don’t think it’s a satellite|He then tilted his
head back and allowed the shot to slide down his throat.
"So tell me Jayy," Ben began, "have you ever worked a
case that you get so involved in, that you couldn’t back off
because even after it had been solved, you felt it was never
truly understood?"
"I’m not sure I know what you mean Ben|Looking at the others, she continued, “Maybe it’s best if everyone gives Peggy a little break.”
When they were all outside the room in the hallway, Mrs. Miller said to Amber and Darren, “We’re going to take Peggy straight home from the clinic tonight.  Please go get all her things from your apartment, put them in her car and bring it back here to the clinic|"'Avin' a bit of a chat wi' the bint, are ye, Billy?" growls the man to his subordinate.

"Just tryin' to bring the poor thing some cheer, Sergeant Gibbs," retorts Private Kent, once more back at Attention.

"Well, belay that and bring 'er out," says Gibbs|Then she leaves me to my own devices. 
I smile and go to knock on Ivy’s door. 
“Ivy. Are you done yet? Can I see?”
“No. I’m still changing,” she shouts back through the door.
Seriously? She’s still changing. I left her for quite some time now and she’s still changing|He didn’t want to give any information away, but he definitely wanted to know what she knew about the cello painting, if anything.
“Do you have any paintings?”
“I can find a painting for you,” she said, as she pulled a business card from her pocket. “This man, he is also looking for a painting|"I wish he would come," she whispered. A smile trembled at her mouth. "I can't wait to meet him."

I slipped my hands around her sides and to her front, covered Elizabeth's hold in mine as we swam in our anticipation. "I've never been more ready for anything, Elizabeth|"Those flowers put out a scent that gives a feeling of great happiness and well-being," said Hamnet. "And then, my guess is, they drag you into the Vineyard and dismember you."

"Whoa! You might have given us a heads-up on that one!" said Gregor.

"We were afraid you would try to fight them," said Hamnet|"Lie, of course," Hunter answered, examining his hand as he slowly withdrew one of his expensive gloves.

Dominique growled.

"Easy. It was a joke." Both gloves fully removed, Hunter swiftly took off his cloak and popped his knuckles before he pulled the dagger from the sheath strapped around his waist and stabbed it into the table.

"You have more than your music to offer the world, Dominique|Setzer eased back on the throttle and caressed a spoke of the wheel. “I’m sorry, love. I’m in a bit of a mood tonight.”
He sighed with a shake of his head as he leaned into the wind. I’m sorry, Maria . . . She resided in his past. It had been a pleasant one, but it was still the past|Nora, Isabella, and Leah suddenly briefly glowed white.
“The forces of good have chosen,” said the second raven.
“What about me?” Maryann asked.
“You will either be an observer, or a referee if the game requires,” said the first.
“Hey!  How come she gets to be the referee|He glanced back and forth between Andrew and me, his hand tightening on the apron.

"Luke, it's not what it looks like-" Andrew started, but Luke cut him off.

"Not what it looks like? It looks like you and Holly were kissing. Like you two have something going on. You want to lie to me about that, Andrew|"Why are you protecting the Malachai?"

She ignored his question. There was no need to go there with him, not when she knew what was really on his mind. "I know the sorrow inside you and I know why it is you did what you did. But in spite of what you think, the death of the Malachai won't give you solace|Teria tried to be pleasant, but people assumed her to be ineffectual.
"Thanks," said Lexia. She sank into one of the two chairs that were neatly set against the wall near the door. Lexia hunched forward and sat on her hands like a child that had been scolded for fidgeting.
"I'm glad you're here, Lexia," said Teria|“Probably merchants off course,” the captain said dismissively. “Send them the verification code.”
“What if it’s not a drill, Sir?” Ninarath asked.
“What’s that?”
“I’m just wondering what would happen if we later found out there really were destroyers in Alliance space. What if all this isn’t a drill|He cupped her face, softly caressing the anxiety lines from the corners of her eyes, feeling an urgent tenderness that had to be expressed. 'You think I began this journey with you because of the packet from Brazil. And yes, it was the trigger that got me moving, but even as I read my father's challenge, I thought...Tess. As I stoked the desire to meet my brothers, I thought...Tess|Gina threw her hands high then let them slap back down against her thighs. "Hey, maybe you should send a memo to my eggs? You know, something short and sweet like,Get in line to be fertilized. What's the holdup? "

He scowled at her. It had no effect of course, because if there was one thing Gina was used to, it was that scowl|"I work fast, Suzan."

Suzan laughed. When she did, her extraordinary chest jiggled in a way that made Cassie certain she wasn't wearing anything underneath her apricot-colored sweater.

"I still don't see the point of Jeffrey Lovejoy," the biker girl said, scowling.

"You don't see the point of any guy, Deborah; that's your problem," said Suzan|"Yours looks good on you," I told Trey. "Looks like all those hours of weight training paid off - and I finally get to see the tattoo." Like Brayden's, Trey's tunic was draped over one shoulder, giving a glimpse of his lower back. Trey, like half the school, had a tattoo|Mr Nail and Silver then reached out and placed the canvas containing the cannon balls on the edge of the plank beyond the gunner's feet. 
Inside the canvas, one of the cannon balls began to roll towards the edge of the plank on which it now sat.
The gunner saw the movement and panicked, bending down away from the ship to try and catch the ball before it rolled off the edge of the plank|You just want your stupid revenge!”
Ember’s eyes widened, her temples pulling taut against her skull.
She crossed the room in two steps, the back of her hand whipping across Ragnar’s face. Ragnar fell against the bedside table and pressed a hand to his cheek.
“Take him to the Air District headquarters,” said Ember|Sadie snorted, “Cisco, please-”
“Is it so difficult to decide?”
“Well, would you answer directly if somebody asked ‘marry me’?!”
“I’d love to marry you!”
“I wasn’t asking!” Sadie slapped his shoulder with little force as both of her eyebrows rose in surprise. If there ever was an opportunistic man, it was Cisco|Your dad used to play in my bar when he was in Santa Monica, and he used to show me pictures of you. He was a brilliant musician; I'm sorry to hear about his death."

"Thank you," Lily said. "He was a great musician."

"Hey, Luke, we need to sit down and discuss what you want to do with the bar|he screamed as he took another swing at the statue, this time connecting with its nose, again pain exploded in his hand.  "Ahh, you’re a tough one stone boy," he wheezed as he held his hand with the other as he tried to stop the throbbing.  He glanced at the statue then stopped suddenly.  It was no longer completely white!
The pain in his hand was ignored as Steven stood up tall and walked to the statue|"Great," Chase said and grinned.

The wheels were in motion. All he had to do was sit back and wait for his bride to come to him.

One

Lesley Campbell glared at the calendar. The last Saturday in June was to have been her wedding day. Only she wasn't going to be a bride|I made a mental list of the most likely places Airi might have gone and checked my map to see if I could check them in some kind of order. At night, when it got too dark to keep searching, I thought it would be a good idea to get to the highest point I could find and hope to see moving lights in the dark areas where the grid had failed, indicating survivors. I knew it was a really long shot, but if there were survivors out there maybe they had seen Airi|Simmons looked at Peter for a few moments before responding, “Look, Major, I can get you what you need, but I can’t do anything about Rachael’s feelings in the matter.”
“I know, sir. She’s gonna be pretty touchy with this.  Thanks for your support.”
They talked for a while about the steps to follow, then Simmons left the office a few minutes before Peter|"Ashlyn, are you sure?"

"I want you, Logan." I kissed him again. Hard.

A broken plea fell from his lips. "Because if you have any doubts...we need to stop now."

"Please don't," I said. He stilled.

"I mean please don't stop, Logan|Was there anything else he could do to speed things up? He had set everything in motion, so far as he could tell, and apart from talking to Moscow, had asked all the questions he needed to ask. 
He guessed it would be some time before they found the car. It could be anywhere, still in this country – Yorkshire perhaps – or even abroad, if they had taken it somewhere on the ferry|Especially when he knew she'd have no problem saying stuff like, "Now go wash your hands and find your manners while you're at it," or sending him to bed even if there was a bunch of people around.

"I can't be the one waiting and wondering what's happening to the rest of you. Not this time." His mom set Boots down and wrapped her arms around Lizzie. "You know what I'm talking about, don't you, Lizzie|They were young and I think social services was looking for a reason to get rid of me at that point, so they more than willingly turned me over to them. Still, they were there for me.

I answer the phone and put it up to my ear right before it goes to voicemail. "What's up?"

"Kelley's getting remarried," he announces in an irritated tone.

"What do you mean she's getting remarried|"Does he have any distinguishing marks?" Darius asked her again, almost fearing her reply.

"He wears glasses." Her lips and chin trembled. "They're wire-rimmed because he thinks they make him look dig-dignified."

"I know not what these glasses are. Explain."

"Cl-clear, round o-orbs for the eyes|You left a cut so deep in my heart

There's no escaping who you are

But I'm your daughter, and I'm your star

You left me alone and full of scars.

There were more important things to you

Then the family that you once knew

You always told me to shine bright

And that I was your shining light.

You left a cut so deep in my heart

There's no escaping who you are

But I'm your daughter, and I'm your star

You left me alone and full of scars|Poppy usually dressed a little extreme for Lawrenceton, and Melinda and I warned her that she had to look like Missy Matron for this crowd, at least till they got to know her. So I wanted to check on what she was planning on wearing. And she told me. And it was the outfit I found her in."

Trumble nodded. Good. This was the kind of fact she liked.

"So, this morning, I got up at six-thirty, showered, had coffee, read the paper, got a phone call from Melinda|The ordeal didn’t last long – perhaps half a minute – and then they settled to the ground.
“All right, Ed,” Deidre said. “The airlock’s cycling. Time for you to go.”
He gulped, nodded, and rose to his feet on shaky knees. “Thanks,” he said, taking a deep breath and making his way to the airlock|"Well, you seem a little out of place here, don't you?" Monson asked out loud. "What about this valley could be so interesting that someone would want to write a history of it?" 
"Master Grey," a voice split the air from the other room.  Monson recognized it as Brian's.
"Yeah, I'm in here, Brian|One boy had a shaved head, medium build, a friendly smile and sharp green eyes. He wore Shininja gear. The other boy was massive, nearly as wide as he was tall. His Berserker attire was quite filled out, especially toward his stomach area.
“How's it going? You can call me Shaved Head or just Shaved will do,” said the boy with the shinija gear|We didn't even plan a honeymoon, because we weren't sure if we were going to have one.

Of course, we still wanted our first night as a married couple to be intimate and special, so when I was asked by the girls where we wanted to spend the night, no place seemed more special and intimate to us than the Lighthouse.

"Sacred space," I spoke out loud, just before Derek pushed me against the door that led to the octagonal room on top of the Lighthouse|After a while, Morgen runs off to play on the garden’s perimeter at the forest’s edge. She picks wildflowers and collects fallen cedar boughs for a make-believe pie, an offering to the forest animals.
We finish planting at dusk. We're tired and hungry, but before we leave we take a long look around at all we’ve accomplished. 
“All this work will be worth it,” I tell Morgen|After twenty minutes, water half-filled the boat. “There’s a small island just a couple of more miles ahead. I think we’ll get to it before we sink completely. Is it too soon in our relationship to ask you if you can swim?”
She muffled a laugh, “Yes, I can swim|Between the disgust in Miracle's eyes and the growing pain in his hand, Hardy was feeling worse by the second. "Here, I'll call 911." Hardy yelped when, out of habit, he reached into his pocket with his right hand to retrieve his phone.

That got Miracle's attention. "Let me see your hand, Hardy|From the plain these towers—the Five Termite Sisters—must dominate the landscape, visible from far away.
Uncle Percy points to a clump of green bushes at the base of the nearest tower.
“That’s the spring where the stream starts. There’s one at the bottom of each tower. The Sisters weeping.”
We walk along the ridge, skirting two of the other towers|That wasn't something she would allow. Kyle would not die.

They were both getting out of this giant freaking grave.

"I wasn't pinned." The words blew lightly over her ear.

Cadence wished she could see Kyle.

She only saw his light.

It was steady now.

"When I was in that car accident, I wasn't pinned|Soon it was time to beach the canoes and head back to the main lodge for a snack. 
As the campers scurried up toward the lodge, Jack spoke to Kacey.
“Hey, great job! I really appreciate your help!”
“Oh, you’re welcome,” she smiled.
He read her nametag and said, “Kacey|The side yard below looked quiet, so he rappelled down and moved to the door about fifty feet away.  It was dark, and he peered inside, moving swiftly into shadows.  She was whimpering nearby.  “Rachael? Rachael, it’s John.”
He heard her feet shuffling closer, but she didn’t say anything.  Her arms flew tightly around his neck, and he could feel her quivering almost-naked body clinging to him in terror|I can make out a large unlit fireplace behind them, and what looks to be a wall of books. It might be a library, but not a real one. It’s like the kind someone has in their home.”
“Wait a minute,” Aunt Morgan chimes in, “that sounds an awful lot like the Russo’s house across the street. I remember being in their den years ago, and there are two walls of nothing but books|A disadvantage to eavesdropping is you never know what’s supposed to be a secret.
“I don’t know,” I lie.
“Would you tell me if you did?”
“Why wouldn’t I tell you?”
“You haven’t told me Adair slapped you.”
“How do you know it was Adair|Just so you know." Why am I telling him this?

"Text me if you want. I know you still have my phone." I add it at the end, and then write my number a corner of my list and give it to him. I don't ask if he knows how to text|He waved the shrunken tablet before Ion’s eyes. “Well, he should have. But I’m sure he never told you why. For this is a tablet which he has secretly kept hidden here for eight millennia now: And he was completely right in do so. Because you see,” He gestured to the tablet|Katrina walked through the house turning on the lights as she went.  
“We need you to get your things, we shouldn’t stay here very long.  Where is your room?” asked Vasquez.
“Up the stairs to the right,” she replied.
“Timms will go up with you, I’ll remain here,” said Vasquez|“Listen, you have no reason to believe me.  But I promise you, the minute I step out of line again, I’ll be the first one to bring myself back to jail.”
A touch of softness appeared in Corey Stone’s hardened expression.  His gun dropped slightly.
“This is the only chance I’ve got, Corey|said Vlod. No one could have done it better. Not Renoir, not Duns Scotus; not even Roy Rogers." 
Macklin was embarrassed. "Well, maybe not Renoir or Duns Scotus," he said. "But Roy Rogers could have done it. I always sort of liked his theme song: 'Happy trails to you, until we meet again--'"
"Dale Evans wrote that," said Vlod|Peter left Lia surrounded by high-maintenance women from Hyde Park and Amberly Village. It was all in the fingernails, he thought. He found fake fingernails a repellent reminder that some people had more money than sense. Money enough, perhaps, to commission a garden of their own? He figured the cooing was a girl thing and headed over to the bar for a beer, promising to bring a mohito for Lia|“It’s got a collar on,” Carlos said as the dog wagged its way over to him. Carlos took hold of the collar. “There’s a mobile number here. It must have escaped.”
“I’ll give them a call,” the manager said. “You hold onto him.”
Carlos pulled the tag off the dog’s collar and handed it to his manager|Mantra was sitting on the same chair, just as idle as always, while Dantox was standing in front of the glass wall by the left, his arms behind his back. The dragonfly like creatures were buzzing about over the place, the only sound heard through the silence. Dantox slowly came walking back to this side of the restaurant, and took a seat beside Mantra|"'Course I might have to answer for it later," I continue, "but then I already have a lot to answer for, don't I, Bliffil? And I think your taking a big gulp of the salt would be the least of them. Just another expendable Intelligence Officer who has done his duty for his King. We all want to do our duty, don't we, Bliffil|If even one student failed, they all had to take a turn in the tank before the end of the summer.”
“And everyone passed?”
With a mouthful of food, Sean nodded. “After that he made the same bet with one class each year at the start of the school year. And every year he ended up in the tank|He unfolds his wings, the black speckles standing out on his white feathers like ink spilled on paper in the dark.

My heart is so heavy with dread and shock, with sadness for Anna, with fear for Angela, with Olivia's death, that I know flight isn't possible. I shake my head at Christian. "I can't."

He looks down at the ground for a minute, thinking, then nods solemnly and retracts his wings|"Baby girl, tell me what's going on in that brain of yours."

She still held me tight to her, "I can't bring myself to look in the mirror, Mom. I'm so ugly now. I have this little pouch and these stretch marks." I was sobbing trying to get the last part out. "You should've seen the way Hunter was looking at me last night, Mom|We let the cab wait for a few minutes while Scout called Daniel and filled him in. He promised to get eyes on the building and try to figure out what Fayden was doing there-and if she'd managed to stash some sort of ongoing spell or magic machine that we could hack or destroy or just plain turn off.

But I had another idea.

I wiggled my fingers to borrow the phone from Scout|I'm sorry, Belgarath, but it was the best I could do."

"It was enough, Sadi," the old man replied bleakly. "Come with me, Garion," he said. "Let's go someplace quiet. You and I are going to have to have a long talk with the Orb."

"Do you suppose that you could hold off on that, Belgarath|“My little pearl, I am so happy to see you,” said Maximilian with a tear in his eye. “I was so worried when I couldn't find you.”
“It was my own fault,” confessed Matilda. “I ignored your advice and ended up being tricked.”
“Well, everything has turned out satisfactorily, thank goodness,” said Maximilian|I learned a few things about myself when I was with her, and one of those things is that I can love a woman as a friend, and I can love a woman as my soulmate. She was always just a friend."

"And I'm ... your soulmate? Me?"

"I believe you are. The question is, do you believe I'm yours|As Dagdron climbed down the tree, the faintest sound of a twig snapping caught his attention. He glanced toward the clearing and saw a cloaked figure on the border, looking after the enchanters. The rogue remained as still as possible, wondering if Mercer had been spying on the enchanters the entire time. Suddenly, the cloaked figure took a couple of steps backward and crouched down, because the enchanter named Kas had returned to the clearing|"I have no intention of fighting for the Midnights. Nor the Daylights. That's not my plan."

"Well, it would seem we agree on that much, but your actual plan is crumbling around you as we speak."

She frowned at him. "What do you mean?" What the Hades did he know about her plan|Gray had both limbs up: one to hold the marked position, the other to spin the wheel.

As she watched, a spear point sliced along her arm.

Gray cried out as a spike stabbed into the back of his hand and pushed his arm off the wheel.

Kneeling in a slightly different position, Seichan snaked her arm between two spikes and got her hand on another section of the wheel|John said, "Hi, this is the Telecommunications Exchange for the Deaf, and I have Gloria on the phone.  She's hearing impaired, so I'm calling for her.  Is this Alan?"
"Yes."
"OK, please hold."
John told the deaf person that he had Alan on the line.  Then she began to type, and John read her message to Alan:  "Hi, Alan, this is Gloria|He'd been the one to ask her out, he'd been the one to pursue her, enjoy the flirting and stolen kisses...the daily texts to make plans for lunch or have coffee, just because. Not just that, Gabriel wanted to settle down. He wanted a wife, a dog, and, eventually, children-God willing.

But he did not want those things with Elise Dumas.

Gabriel blinked, the errant thought completely taking him by surprise, because there was absolutely nothing wrong with Elise|I'm about to bleed the venom out, so bear with me."

Rome growled at me, "What did you do, Cora?"

I just shook my head. "You all need closure, and this was the only way I could think to do it. You told me you had to figure it out on your own, and that's just not true, Rome|To my surprise, Lucas shook his head. "You're safest in here, certainly, but you can explore the ship if you'd like. Provided," he added, holding up a hand to keep me from speaking, "one of my men is with you at all times."

I frowned at him, which he appeared to ignore|“I guess we’ll have to depend on the defense to win this one,” said Cain, still not convinced that the offense would correct itself.  “Maybe we can intercept a pass or score on a fumble.”
“O.K.” laughed Mr. Andrews, trying to assure Cain.
“Well, we just gotta win,” said Cain|Emily asked, looking around.

Cassie shrugged. "Is Bellissima okay?"

"That's fine," Emily answered, feeling pleasantly surprised that Cassie wanted to hang out with her alone.

As Emily let herself out of the gate, she glanced over her shoulder. Luckily Mrs. Meriwether was still occupied with Rudolph and didn't notice that Emily was hanging out with Cassie|"I admit Trantor is a fairly nonseismic planet-and a good thing, too, because enclosing a world in a dome when the world is going to shake itself badly several times a year and smash a section of that dome would be highly impractical. Your mother says that one of the reasons Trantor, rather than some other world, became the Imperial capital is that it was geologically moribund-that's her unflattering expression. Still, it might be moribund, but it's not dead|Fischer followed Shane’s commands wordlessly, his brain clicking and spinning like a film reel, rolling memories of doctorate classes, searching for anything he'd learned on the subject of life and death, but his projector's lamp was off.
"Why are you in my house, Pat? Why do you have my gun?"
Interrupting, Shane raised his glass. “To the truth,” he said.
Fischer raised his and Dr.ank, keeping his eyes locked on Shane|dozens of voices called out in unison. "Washington, D.C.!"

"Yes. There are nine million pounds of ironwork in that dome. An unparalleled feat of architectural ingenuity for the 1850s."

"Awesome!" somebody shouted.

Langdon rolled his eyes, wishing somebody would ban that word. "Okay, and how many of you have ever been to Washington|“I’ll send it in, I promise,” she told him again.

The following week, Selena was shocked when Matt entered her hotel room and threw a magazine on the bed by her. “What is this, Selena?” She was surprised at his angry tone and she had no idea what he was talking about. She set her laptop to the side as she looked at the magazine|Vera sits down beside her mother, who smiles.

"He's back," Mama says.

"He brought food," Vera says.

Mama struggles to sit up. Vera helps her, repositions her pillows behind her.

Once she's upright, Mama's foul breath taints the air between them. "Go spend the day with your family, Vera|"It better be all good, or Luke will be in trouble," Annie said as she shot Luke a look.

"Of course it's all good." I smiled.

Luke's father held his arms out. "It's nice to meet you, Lily. You can call me Tom."

"It's nice to meet you, Tom|He carried her to the bathroom and reaching inside the shower, flicked on the taps while she struggled in his hold. "Ryan, please. I just want to sleep."

Ryan ignored her. Stretching out a hand, he checked the temperature of the water as steam began pouring out. Setting her on her feet, he nodded at the shower|Daisy began to tire. She had been flying for several hours now with no let up from the opposition. She flew lower, trying to shake the pursuers. As she did, Alden recognized the landscape below them. He had flown Optimistic over this territory many times.
“We’re almost to the castle, Daisy|"Oh..." Jenny felt limp as seaweed. "Oh ... sure."

"Great. And your dress is what color?"

Audrey had come over and was leaning her copper head close to the earpiece. "Tell him gold," she whispered.

"Gold," Jenny repeated automatically, then looked at Audrey|“How was I supposed to know he had anger issues?” 

Kaia paced before Argus. “So you will find another human to carry Aurelius. I suppose you found the one to carry the dragon jewel?”

“The Dragon Mage will find that hero, it has been foretold.”

“No, it has not been foretold|The two of them curled together like giant balls of fluff on the thick green carpet, instead of on the bed in the corner. One cub was brown and one black. Beautiful and sweet, she adored her nephews.

Aimee lay down beside them so that she could lift Bryce's paw and play with his claws while he slept. She remembered lying on her brothers in much the same fashion when she'd been a cub|I saw them; Lucca was just a few feet away from Wind.  The latter had his torso wrapped in bandages, and he was barefoot.  It’s a surprise Amaya let him out in this condition.
“Lucca, I’ll talk to you about the barrels…”  I said.
“No! Trickster! You’re the one who had me sign the release of a hundred barrels|His gut knotted, hard, brutal twisting lumps of fear. "Is that what you need to be happy with me, Jaimie? Pretty words?"

Jaimie studied his face. His expression was a mask. Unreadable. But he was holding his breath. Actually holding his breath. If she didn't answer him soon, he was going to turn blue|Because of my respect for you, I've never been able to say the words I'm really thinking when we are in session. But now I am going to say whatever I think, no matter what it is. 
I can do that because of my idea which, if you'll be patient, I'll tell you about. That's funny. I ask you to be patient, but I am your patient|That was when he caught her smiling over the rim of her glass and realized that any illusion he'd ever had of being in charge of their evening was just that-an illusion.

Because in a matter of sentences, Megan had him right where she wanted him: acting like a jealous idiot.

Again.

Wanting a little retribution, he pulled her closer to him, her back pressed into his chest. "I'm glad you're here, Megan|Granted, it might be hard to maneuver on a wooden bench, but doing it in a boat seemed sufficiently wild to satisfy her feverish need to be free of constraints.

"We could capsize. We could float into the reeds and get the motor tangled. We could drift too close to the bank and get stuck."

"Couldn't those things happen anyway?" Marley glanced around, but she couldn't see the shore|Passing between the giant statues of Saint Peter and Saint Paul that stood guard before the basilica, she glanced at the inscription below the sword-bearing apostle Paul. In Hebrew, it read, "I can do all things in Him who strengthens me." She couldn't read Hebrew, but it had been her uncle Vigor who had taught her the words as a young girl. She took strength from both that message and the memory of her uncle|"My friends, we must face a fact that has been staring us in the face for generations. The First Law has taught us to take no chances. It has taught us that all risk is bad, and that the safest way to avoid risk is to avoid effort and let the robots do it, whatever it is. Bit by bit, we have surrendered all that we are and all that we do to the robots|She seemed to have a wall built around her that hid the real her from everyone else. I would like to say that perhaps we could be friends, but I really didn't know if she would let anyone that close.

I thought back to when I first met her. The day she sold me Hev's bracelet. I hadn't perceived any of those things then|Nor could he describe the complexity of what he felt for Amanda to anyone without it seeming idiotic. Yes, he cared about her. Yes, he was falling in love with her. Yes, he could see settling in and loving her for a good long time. But no, they couldn't be together.

It seemed stupid even to him.

"Shelby has some good news, Amanda|They'd cost only fifty pence each, and the location was clearly marked, so the transaction hadn't ranked highly on her priority list for investigating. Now, however, Alice felt an urge to see which paintings it was that Ella had wanted to take with her.

After tapping away at his computer for a few seconds, Charles made a note next to the final code and passed it back to Alice|Vince and the 9 women watched as two sentries walked past the chairs they were sitting on.  The sentries passed every few minutes.  They were mostly old men past the age 70, or young women.  A crescent moon was hung in the sky along with Cassiopeia, the Great Bear, Orion etc.

`One or more of you is a spy,' said Vince|Rose was too far back for him to see her body, although
he could see her outstretched arm and the gun she held
in her hand, It was only inches from Anna’s forehead.
Anna was rocking back and forth. Her head was shaking
from side to side. Ben wriggled a little further out from
behind the bar and crawled across the kitchen floor
toward the doorway, he kept his eyes on Anna|"This is Mr. Mallard," she said, indicating the duck that sat to her right.

"And this is his daughter, Lilly," she explained, pointing to the duckling that was squished into a tiny high chair across the pink plastic table from me.

"It's nice to meet you, Lilly|It was four days later that Johansen told Shiloh the bad news while they were on their way to HQ for another meeting with Admiral Howard.

“I hear that the call for volunteers for the recon mission has gone out,” Shiloh said. 

Johansen looked away and nodded. After a few seconds she turned back to Shiloh|"Crystals," Marika said.

He glanced sharply at her. "That's correct. Sometimes the Great Wind would blow small shards from the city into the desert sands. I'd dug up dozens, some as large as my thumbnail." He held up his stumped wrist. "That is, when I still had a thumb|Same food we saw and ate on the spaceship except some items were different. 
They had large bowls of something like fruits. Strange looking things. They also had something like cottage cheese, it tasted like sour milk but after the initial taste, alright. I encouraged each team member to eat and drink. We might as well get used to the food|It was possible that Gilbert knew this and so informed the king of the clandestine meetings in hopes that the king’s interference in the prince’s matter would give him an opportunity to get to the men without Prince Henry’s restrictions.  “Possible.”  Adrian said out loud in response to his own thoughts.
“What is?”
“Orwell, what if Sir Gilbert wanted to have vengeance on these men for some unknown reason, like the situation with Sir Chavelle de Chaumont?  What if he informed the king of their presence and then got them out of the hands of the prince|She darts down the hall a little ways so that it won't look as if she's been doing precisely what she's been doing, and is there examining her fingernails with what she hopes is a look of great nonchalance when Dad appears alongside the minister.

"Hadley," he says, clapping a hand on her shoulder and addressing her as if they see each other every day. "I want you to meet Reverend Walker."

"Nice to meet you, dear," the elderly man says, taking her hand and then turning back to Dad|“Now, come with me,” Mae flicks her hand down to the square.
I follow.
As I do, I shut my mind off. The caring, feeling side—I just put up a wall. I won't react, I tell myself. No matter what she does, I won't react|The buzzing sensation that had completely consumed her and made her unable to breathe while looking into Joshua’s eyes was unlike anything she had ever experienced with Benjamin, and an unwelcome thought telling her that she might be missing out on a lot in her relationship with Ben was very persistent and took strong focus to dismiss. She pushed the thoughts of Joshua away and remembered Mr. White’s words about meeting everyone with kindness. She felt overwhelmed and took a shower and tried to relax and do her homework.

Her mind, however, kept going back to Joshua|I love walking into an ice arena: the cold air, the smell of the ice, freshly smoothed by the Zamboni, and the sounds of skates leaving their mark on the ice. The smell of the cold rink fills my lungs as I breathe in, and I can't help but bounce on my toes with excitement. The rink is huge; it looks like a full-size hockey arena.

Still holding hands, we walk over to get skates|But she only stood, sad and silent.

She walked me back to my chamber in silence. We had left the glass open at the balcony and white moths had fluttered in. They hovered around the fireplace, white powder puffing from their wings. I sat on the bed and stared at the moths|"'There's but one man who'll know what to do,' I said to myself. Forgive me, but you must know what they say about you and the curious goings-on in this house. Only the deaf would not know about Pellinore Warthrop and the house on Harrington Lane!"

"Then I am fortunate," said the doctor dryly, "that you are not deaf|His grandparents, his mother’s parents, were sorcerers? How was that possible?

Allyson sat in the comforting darkness of the old vaults under the city. She drew her shawl around her shoulders as she thumbed through her grandmother’s old leather volume she had found hidden in her mother’s wardrobe. She mouthed words to old spells and wove her hands in complicated patterns, after she had finished secretly delivering the last of the files to the people who needed to be reminded they came from a line of sorcerers|She was probably going to have to move back in here, until she found a place of her own, and she was not looking forward to being under the same roof as her parents again. But what choice did she have? No matter what Bryce said, she was not going to marry him. No matter how things had ended with Ryan, her time with him had shown her that she didn't want to be with Bryce|She seemed so refined, in a light blue dress with pearls strung around her neck. I stood with Vivian to be introduced.

"Emily Thomas, I am pleased for you to meet Dr. Michelle Vassar. She is an alum from Stanford University, and was on their women's basketball team."

Dr. Vassar offered her hand, "Nice to meet you, Emily|"Genuine haunted house with a real live ghost and all that."
"Actually, no," Maryann returned, looking at reviews of the place on her phone.  "Apparently it's not haunted at all.  That's also apparently a bad thing here."
"How come everyone's so sure it's not haunted|But it was the words that Paul wrote in his own hand that brought a lump to her throat.

Merry Christmas, Rabbit.

I know it was a rough first semester and I'm sorry I didn't do a better job of helping you when you needed it. I'm proud of you for not quitting. With a big Vermont hug

from your friend, Paul|I just wanna make it special y’know?”
“Make what special?” she asked, a confused look on her
face.
“The next time I enter a room alone with you, we both
know what’s gonna happen…” He stared directly into her
big brown eyes. “And I just wanna make sure when it
happens, that it’s special|When he had regained consciousness, he discovered that he was standing in a deep, cylindrical tube, a kind of silo. About fifteen feet high, its walls were perfectly smooth, coated with plaster that had been painted and then finished with something to make it shine. High beyond his reach were two big flood lamps that burned continuously. There was a total absence of darkness, not even a hint of shadows|As soon as he said it, he winced. "Sorry."

"It's okay." She waved off the apology even as she shrugged off the memories the mention of the fire department had caused. After all, it had only been a single day since her house had become uninhabitable. Not surprising that she was still a little touchy on the subject of fire|This is just a waiting area, so it should be empty until morning."

Teren sighed. "Yeah, it's getting late. We're running out of time, we need to hurry."

Ashley nodded and opened the doors. Teren paused before going through, placing his hand on her arm. "I'm very sorry you got dragged into this, Ashley|“Of course it was my fault for being willing to take anything at all.”
“So, I’m guessing she broke up with you?” Katja said. This was the part that made her nervous. Micah was a guy obsessed with a girl who obviously wanted out of the relationship.
He stared out the window and then back at Katja|She just found out she's being forced to do a mate run.  You do know what that is?”
He wrinkled his brow a moment.  “Unfortunately, yes.  I've read about it in the archives.  It’s a horrible mating custom.”  He shuddered.
She shook her head.  “It's nothing so gentile as a custom|Norton being happy to see Jake when Brianne was around was unusual, and the knot in Jake's stomach tightened.

He knelt down beside the excited dog. "Come on, boy. Where is she?" he whispered.

Norton nudged Jake's leg and started running. Jake mentally took back any bad thing he'd ever said or thought about the dog|They kept walking and looking with their heads up but they didn’t engage any of the Forest Randers by looking in their eyes.
When the horses crossed in front of them they turned and walked parallel toward the last rider and when he passed, Bobby and Frank walked on silently, taking in the scenery and watching Rainbow people move across the landscape.  Finally, without looking at him, Frank said, “What’s the matter with you Bobby|Her cousin was five years younger than she and Chandani knew that this news had already reached her mother through a time-delayed international call – probably just before or after her cousin had typed her message. 
 Chandani had grown up with the clamor of the phone ringing at all hours of the day or night.  When she had been little, and they all lived in a one-bedroom apartment, she remembered falling asleep and awaking to the sound of her father’s voice, shouting, just to be heard over the crackles of the poor connection|His warm body against mine relaxed me, but sleep still seemed impossible with all the thoughts running through my head. The same thoughts I'd had earlier raced through my mind.

Before I had time to think it through, I found myself blurting out, "Do you think there is a reason why she left?"

I hadn't thought about the fact that I could have just woken him up, but he turned to me, still awake|“You cheeky monkey, I don’t walk funny.”
Juliet giggled and he threw a slipper at her.
“When I get these trousers on, I’ll tickle you like a monkey.”
Juliet shrieked and ran out of the room while Jakob hurriedly tried to pull his trousers up.  As soon as he managed to finally get them around his waist, he picked up the other slipper|said Holiday with a more-cheerful-than-usual smirk.
The beginning of orientation consisted of basic household rules:  Respect for department property, superiors, and peers.  Absolutely no girls in the guys’ dorm or guys in the girls’ dorm—except on special prearranged and properly supervised occasions.  “Call us old fashioned if you wish,” said Holiday|When we reach the small stream, Raina bounces ahead but John was quick to cut her off, “Raina, careful. Some of the scents are fresh.”
“I know, but they’re not here. They mainly come at night.” 
I look at Liam. Even John seems as surprised as we are.
“How do you know this, Raina|In essence, she was creating a therapy that would synchronize everyone: the dying, the devolving, and the rapidly evolving, creating a unified, stable genome. An Atlantean-human hybrid genome.

After almost half an hour of work, the screen flashed a message.

One Target Therapy Identified.

Kate examined it. Yes, it would work.

She should have felt euphoria, pride, or even relief|A window popped up in the middle of the screen that showed a security camera view of the only entrance to the Dome. It was a wide roll-up door sunk into the base of a rocky mountain above the complex. The door led to a garage and then to an elevator. The elevator ran down a wide shaft and ended in a long hallway which fed directly into the Dome|Then she watched me and allowed me to make a decision for myself. I gripped the stake and was about to approach my wife to drive the stake into her heart, but I found myself hesitating. Is this what she does with Derek? I stopped and looked at my daughter. "How many times have you done something like this to Derek|Dizzy didn’t know if Justin and his friends were referring to him and Travis directly as the “idiots in line behind them.” Travis looked at Dizzy and raised his eyebrows. He nodded his head toward the group in front of them, as if to say, go for it.
	“Matterhorn has a basketball court inside it,” Dizzy said. Justin, his friends, and Megan all turned to look at Dizzy|"Jess, I love you, but you're kind of hurting me." I glanced down at our locked hands-mine was turning a deep shade of red from the death grip she had on me.

She immediately let go. "Oh, sorry! I'm a little nervous."

"Obviously"-I smiled at her-"It's going to be fine, Jess|They said you could hear her mad laughter a mile off, and of course, while mad laughter was always part of a witch's stock-in-trade in necessary circumstances, this was insane mad laughter, the worst kind. And she turned people into gingerbread and had a house made of frogs. It had been very nasty, towards the end. It always was, when a witch went bad. Sometimes, of course, they didn't go bad|Joseph also noticed the guard not far away, prepared to rush forward in an instant if he was needed.

When Richard Storm turned around with an indulgent smile on his face as if he were about to appease a couple of batty old men, it didn't take long for his jaw to slacken as he stared at the two strangers.

"Hello Richard. This is my brother, George, and I'm Joseph|“Well, she does have a day job. No, I should say, an evening job.”
“You are not making any sense. So, can I meet this Ana before I leave for America? You know I am leaving soon. My restaurant needs me.”
“I will arrange for you to meet Ana|That’s why we’re here, to meet with you. If you’ll come with me, I’ll introduce you.” She grabbed his arm and almost dragged him to another lady holding a big sign. “This is Monica Swathmore, Britney’s mother.”
Monica held out her hand and Adam shook it. “I’m pleased to meet you, Monica|"A detour? Seriously, Shane? The clouds were building up when I fell asleep a bit ago. You had to have noticed!" she exclaimed.

"I did, but it wasn't so bad," he said, knowing he sounded ridiculous.

"You weren't thinking at all, Shane|When Cole and Robin entered, the Labrador lifted his head and wagged his tail in greeting.

The fort wasn't much bigger than the tent Jeff had constructed the night before, and Robin was forced to pull her knees close and loop her arms around them. Cole's larger body seemed to fill every available bit of space.

Jeff must have sensed that his newfound home had been invaded because his eyes fluttered open and he gazed at Robin, then turned his head to stare at Cole|“With my current budget and free time, I will be long dead before any visible progress is made on the machine. I can no longer go on like I have. Without more time and monies, the project will have to be halted.”
Devalier smiled. “Your financial troubles are over, professor.” The man removed from his pocket the cheque, and handed it to the professor|None of them will ever speak to you again, not even to make a full Circle. The coven will be destroyed too."

Cassie's teeth were clenched. She wanted to hit Faye, but it wouldn't do any good. Because Faye was right. And Cassie thought she could stand being blackballed, being a pariah at school again; she even thought she could stand to destroy the coven|“I doubt they think about it. It’s just become sort of a custom.”
“Well, that poor dog is vastly overweight and I think that’s one custom that should be stopped.”
“Why don’t you tell Gilbert when he comes?”
“I take it you’ve met Gilbert|Abigail moved to a worn armchair, that Abe thought might have been red, but now was a dusky pink.  Abe and Benedict moved to sit on the couch that sat next to the chair. There was a small coffee table in front of both chair and sofa, and two other jars full of fireflies sat on either end. Benedict put the lantern in the middle of the table, before turning to Abigail|Her heart sank at his words. Though she already knew it was coming, it still ached to hear him say it. "Back to the exciting life, huh?"

He shook his head. "My life in New York isn't all that glamorous. For the most part, it's about work|"You can't date my brother," he growled. "Any of my brothers."

"What are you talking about?"

He advanced on her even as she backed up to get away from him. "Zach. He went to your house on Sunday."

"He fixed my flat tire."

"I'll bet that's not all he wants to fix|"Sure, I would love to spend the day with Hailey and you tomorrow."  Doug finally replied.
As Hailey perched her rounded body in Doug's lap and tried to eat her stew.  Liquid on a spoon was a task she was still mastering.  In her graceful attempts, she spilled the hot stew all over Doug's lap.
"Oh no," he called out as he pushed her off and stood up, while he did this, Hailey's elbow knocked the rest of the soup all over her and Doug|“Beth isn’t a hunter,” I say loudly.  My friend flinches.
There’s laughter in my head.  My mouth gapes.  “Beth?”
“What?”  Delilah is looking between us.  It takes her a moment to put everything together, and I’m not sure I’m quite there yet.  “B,” Delilah says, “you’re a hunter|We finished breakfast and refil ed our cups, settling onto the sofa. Melanie lay against me, and I wrapped us in a warm blanket. In silence, we watched the snow flurries melt as the flakes landed in the water.

We lay like that for what seemed like hours, lost in thought. I ignored my phone ringing on the kitchen table, unwil ing to get up and interrupt my time with Melanie|What had he done, scaled the walls like Spiderman? Is he Spiderman? His name is Peter.

"What do you want?" My arms are tired of holding the trophy up, but I'm not putting it down.

"I wanted to see you."

"Why?" I almost yell it, wanting a straight answer so I can decide whether or not to freak out or hit him with the trophy|I fell in love with your passion, the beautiful moments of vulnerability when I get to see the Jacob that no one else knows. But it's more than seeing the real you. You see the real me. And when you asked me to marry you--" My voice cracked and I let the tears that rushed to my eyes streak down my cheeks. "You're the love of my life, Jacob|"What do you mean?"

"We have all been worshipped in the past, but for most of us it is in the long past. For Conchenn it has been less than three hundred years. She was still being worshipped in Europe when we were asked to... leave."

"So you're saying that she's got more power because she was being worshipped|He glanced back and forth between Andrew and me, his hand tightening on the apron.

"Luke, it's not what it looks like-" Andrew started, but Luke cut him off.

"Not what it looks like? It looks like you and Holly were kissing. Like you two have something going on. You want to lie to me about that, Andrew|"Too strong for me," Sheerin said. "And a little too sweet,-Do you have neltigir, by any chance?"

"The Jonglorian brandy? I'm not sure. How do you want it, if I can find some?"

"Straight," said Sheerin. "Please." To Theremon and Beenay he said, "I developed a liking for it while I was up north Thc food's awful in Jonglor, but at least they can distill a deceni brandy|Sebastian fidgeted in the booth and tapped his fingers against the menu. Becky avoided him by flipping through the jukebox songs.

Dixie, a familiar waitress, came over. She wore her hair in a black beehive, and her curvy figure was squeezed into her white uniform like a forties pinup girls. When she wasnt reading a tabloid magazine at the soda counter, she was heckling her customers|"Yeah," Monson said finally, trying to keep the nervousness out of his voice. "I wasn't paying attention. I'm really sorry I knocked you over." 
"You're sorry, " she said this time without a trace of sympathy. "You are . . . sorry. Oh, well, if you are sorry|“I was wondering if I could see the Golden Phoenix?”
“What Golden Phoenix?” said Li Peng in a shocked voice.
“The one that was stolen from the Dragon Palace two nights ago,” replied Matilda.
“Who told you that I have it?”
“Apparently one of your soldiers was captured and confessed,” said Matilda|She had practically wasted the whole morning with her uncontrolled thoughts about Dane and she was now regretting that she had let them prevent her from doing what she should have been doing.  When she walked into her house, she heard her father’s voice in the living room.
She assumed he was on the phone again, so she peeked inside the room to motion that she was going upstairs|“Now, my dear, what is it you wanted to show me?”
“This way.” She led him around behind Barbara’s desk. On top was the file box with Barbara’s notes. JJ had lugged it upstairs one more time. She faced William and took a deep breath.
“Do you know what this is, William|“We should never incur their wrath like the Phoenix.”
In an alley, the pale-white wolf gazed at the siblings as their car sped by, and the Tainted Rain soiled its fur and turned its coat a pale-gray.  The raven perched above the wolf on a fire escape and crowed softly.  The large bird was never far from the wolf|He would make jokes.

The thought spurred the vicious part of him into a gallop. Jokes. Right.

For the first hour and a half, John had kept his mouth shut, probably waiting for him to talk. Waiting for "How could you abandon us, Father?" and "I've waited for you to come back, Father|It took a bit longer, and took reserves of strength he hadn't realised he possessed, to break right through and release Amaryllis.
'Thank goodness for that,' she wheezed as she climbed through the gap. 'There were some seriously nasty spiders in there.'
'Spiders? You had me getting repetitive stress injury in my elbow just because you don't like spiders|I'll serve you up some chili."

He went without protest. Grabbing two bowls she served enough for each of them, then sprinkled the tops with cheese before heading toward the table with him.

She saw him take the first spoonful, and the look on his face filled her with confidence. "I take it you like my chili|Father Hilliard lowered his hand and the two turned toward the house and proceeded to cross the street, unhurried.
“So, how is Shelly holding up? She seemed upset on Sunday.”
“She’s doing better. She’s home with the kids. Her father,” Ted shook his head angrily, “he bailed on us again.”
“We all do what we can, Ted|Lance chuckled, picking up the teasing thread as any decent crew dog would. "Refresh my memory, Cutter."

"Something about copilot upgrades to aircraft commander. And how he'll never get one ... because he talks too much!"

Lance coughed into the headset. "Almost made me choke on a cookie with that, Cutter|All warnings have one exception, eh? Yourself! That's what I see and that's what amuses me. You laugh at them in my productions, but you don't know why you laugh. Ahh, Kelexel, here's where we hide the awareness of our own mortality."

Kelexel spoke in shocked outrage: "We're not mortal|Mantra considered his words, and the tone of urgency in them. Something occurred to him, so that his speeding thoughts halted in their tracks. 

“We need to find the level of inhabitation in this planet.”

The two others looked at him together. 

“Level of inhabitation?” Nano stopped folding his arms and looked straight at Mantra|As the paramedics unloaded the patient onto the hospital bed, Amber began an IV in his hand.  She listened as the paramedic filled them in on what happened.
“He was found at the local gas station.  One of the pumps blew up and caught the building on fire.  The guy was trapped in one of the store rooms before the firefighters were able to pull him out,” said the paramedic|Parked near the waiting helicopter and got out. They could hear the groan of the organ and the sound of people singing inside the church. No crowds. No media. It was a dignified scene. There was a Casper PD cruiser parked at a discreet distance. There was an Air Force crewman in a flight suit standing next to the helicopter|“We all have lives outside of the department,” said Mandy.  “The director makes sure this is just our job, not our life.”
“So what do you guys like to do when you’re off?”
“Play guitar!” Dizzie said without hesitation.
“You should hear the Lawn Flamingos—that’s Dizzie’s band,” said Mandy|“What are you talking about?”
“He told me that the castor bean poison had been mixed into the frosting and that that would make me the best suspect, chemistry and baking.”
David looked a bit confused and he stayed quiet for a second.
“Green Eyes, you said that Pete told you the poison was in the frosting|protested Jack after the Chief was gone. "We won't be able to publish research papers or have artifacts examined by other researchers. Joining the Tribe will be a complete disaster from a scientific research perspective."
"Not as complete a disaster as being dead would be," noted Doc. "I've known these people longer than you have, Jack|And Max was right. I was tired of pretending to like Carter.

Carter broke the kiss and sat up straight. Beyond Carter's broad body, Max stared at me with a scowl on his face. He turned back to the movie screen and didn't look at me again. I was so preoccupied by what Max's scowl had meant that I couldn't focus on the rest of the movie|She reached for the carton. "Thanks," she said. She ate a couple of bites in silence, took a sip of tea, all the while tensed for the questions to begin, as they surely must.

What do you dream about, Eliza?

How am I supposed to help you if you won't talk to me, Eliza|In high school I had taken all the AP courses I could, while Jessi had taken only the classes she was required to in order to graduate.

"Oh, by the way who is your friend here, Kels?" Caught up in the distraction of class talk, I'd totally forgotten to introduce Kane.

"Um"-I cleared my throat-"This is Kane|It didn't take long before Kyle caught up with me and Anna.

"Where are you taking her?" he asked.

"To my quarters. She'll be safer there."

He looked at me suspiciously before turning his eyes toward the lovely young woman who was staring blankly at the space ahead of us. "Did he ever touch you, Anna|“Stay here,” he said, turning to go back inside.
“Wait!” I grabbed his arm. He shrugged out of my grasp and ran back inside.
I stayed put exactly two seconds before running in after him. I stopped in the kitchen and felt for the flashlight we kept under the sink. My fingers fumbled around, my eyes blind in the darkness, until I found the flashlight|“Yes, we were just discussing which one we want to use,” said Det. Christian.
“I’m thinking we need a place that’s spread out.  Not close to other houses.  Clear lines of sight,” said Captain Weatherspoon.
“Then we need to use the house on Donaldson.  It fits that description perfectly,” said Christian|Scott sets our alarm clock to go off in the middle of the night so we can get up and stoke the fire to keep the cabin warm. The windows are frosted, covered with ice crystals. 
After a couple weeks, we're almost used to it. I watch from my office for Scott to pull up in the jeep|Many times, Damen marveled at how happy she seemed, just because she was with him. It was a humbling thought, and one that made him even more possessive of her.

Stavros nodded curtly. "I understand. But I do intend to speak to her soon. I have searched for her for a very long time, Damen|Quick as lightning, the blade extended from the hilt. Andy held it up straight, but the blade instantly tipped to the side. He corrected it, straightening its position, but again it tipped to the side.
“That’s weird,” Alden remarked.
“I think it’s trying to point us out of the forest,” said Andy|"Is this the best you could do?"

There's silence, followed by a muffled giggle and footsteps. Thankfully, they're too loud to be mice. A person, then.

"Char? Mads?" My voice is thin and high-pitched.

They don't answer. A horrible thought strikes me: What if it isn't them|Of course, he hadn't actually said anything about that, but Elena herself was sure. She was going to marry Stefan, or no one. And Stefan was going to marry no one but her...

The transition into dreaming was so smooth and gradual that she scarcely noticed it. But she knew, somehow, that shewas dreaming|General Tilghman is takin’ everyone there tomorrow. Do you understand?”
Frank stared at the ground, lit ruddy red in the firelight. The heavy rain pummeled the mud into different shapes. He didn’t know what to say. It all sounded so final. Jimmy took a drink of brandy from his flask, winced, and offered it to Frank|"Do you think she's lying?" Teria picked at her fish. It was bland without the sauce. Gaent piled fish on to his flatbread and ate with gusto.
"I think she believes what she's saying. But I wonder if it really happened."
"Lystus could have run off to join the Polities Guard," said Teria|“It may look different, but that is nothing to be ashamed of.  It just has a different kind of beauty.”
Bryn was impressed he remembered what she said in class.  In fact, those were almost the exact words she had used.  “Perhaps you’re right about that.  I do not deny the creature to have the right to think it is beautiful|“It’ll never be better.”
“We could do a quick hit and run. Be in and out before they know we were there.”
“They wouldn’t know anyway.” Stan shook his head. “It’s not worth the risk.”
Anne gritted her teeth. “Isn’t what we’re doing a risk|As Gil led them along towards the lake, he broke the calm quiet of the morning in the woods, “That’s what most people in Stansbury believe in anyway.”
Marisol took the bait and probed, “And what do you believe?”
“It’s not what I believe so much as what I know to be true.  I’ve done quite a bit of research into the Lakebridge and into the history of Stansbury|They're like a safety net for me and my emotions now instead."

"And you don't think that safety net is a good thing?" She scrawls something on her pad.

"No, it is. But I don't think I need one as big. I'd like to think I could maybe catch myself before I needed that net|He has retreated toward his own land. The others will find him and regroup their army," said Ares.

It took Gregor a moment to recognize the mouse they placed on the next raft. He looked smaller, more vulnerable, dead. "Is that Cartesian?"

"He died defending the nursery," said Ares|"I don't know what you mean," he answered evasively.

"I respectfully disagree." Malcolm held his temper in check. Barely. "You're just trying to get me to say what I found out on my own in case I didn't learn everything. Then you can continue to hold back."

"We can play this game for a long time, Malcolm|It wasn’t Rebekah, but instead Austin and Timothy. They walked up the driveway and barged in the house, not even knocking. Ramer immediately woke up and stood up at the sight of them. 
“Darius Ramer?” Austin asked. 
“Yes,” Darius replied. Then Austin pulled out a gun. 
“Prove it,” He said, aiming his gun at Darius|He shook his head. "They're lying. Neither of them can read her either."

"Why lie?" Victor asked with a frown.

DJ shrugged. "Who knows? Maybe they're waiting to see what happens with the council."

Victor grimaced. At the rate he'd been working, or not working as the case may be, they'd have a long wait to see what happened with the council|This is, like, my entire schooling with all the subjects I ever had to study throughout my entire life jammed into one, then multiplied by like, twelve!” Knob yelled out in frustration.
“Why twelve?” Crass asked. Gisbo laughed obnoxiously from his bunk. “And as for you, yeah you, up there on the bunk|Which was why he was startled to hear himself proclaim boldly, "If I were to climb up to you — to press a kiss to your lips as you did to mine earlier — perhaps you would not be so quick to stab me with your sharp tongue, my lady." His words provoked an unexpected image of her tongue stabbing sweetly at his mouth in passion, not anger.
She leaned over the balcony's edge and spoke softly into the night. "What makes you think I want your kiss|Tell me, does he use utensils at the table or merely growl and chew his meat like a brute?"

"Both." Rosalind laughed. "But to be fair, he has been very good to me."

Lord Rawlings squinted, looking into her eyes with such seriousness that she felt the need to turn away. "And the state of your heart, Rosalind|Instead, she phoned the kitchen and ordered two meals for dinner, though she wasn't sure she would feel hungry.

Blake seemed lost in thought when he returned to the lodge that evening, so Samantha didn't mention it straightaway. Besides, she didn't want to sound like a harping wife.

She managed to wait until they had almost finished dinner before saying offhand, "By the way, Blake|As she entered her eyes fell upon the stick in Holmes's hand, and she ran towards it with an exclamation of joy. 'I am so very glad,' said she. 'I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I would not lose that stick for the world.' 
'A presentation, I see,' said Holmes|Karen closed the door after her and came around to the driver’s side. Opened the door and climbed in herself. She did not start the car, but waited for Beth to speak.
Looking straight ahead, but not seeing, Beth spoke. “He’s been strange lately. Not like before strange, of course, not, you know, hitting or anything,” she looked over at Karen|"No, I can't," she said as she tightened her hold. "You got all grisly, akri. Like one of them things at home. Ew! The Simi don't like that. You gots to stay nice and pink like you're supposed to. Or blue. I don't mind it when you're blue|Mouse and Talking Owl helped Turtle Man lay upon his bed. The old man was smiling but obviously exhausted from the long ceremony and the incident involving the near extinguishing of the Eternal Flame. "EXPLAIN THEIR DUTIES, MOUSE," he thought. "I MUST REST."
"Yes, Great One," responded Mouse|Hurriedly, I bolted from the room and left the building.
“What a creep,” said Rachel, “I knew I never liked him.  How did he get to be a professor?”
“I don’t know,” I said wanting to get as far away as I could.
“You should report him,” said Rachel|Gran had parked her car around back while she was unloading, so it wouldn't look like she was here, just me. She had given Bill a ride home, but he helped her unload and went to change clothes. After he left, whoever it was ... got her."

"How do we know it wasn't Bill|After some careful maneuvering Emma managed to get the box down the ladder without dropping it or falling down herself, a feat she was a little surprised she accomplished. Emma glanced at the clock. 9:50. Kathryn and Steve would be home soon. 
Grabbing the box she hurried to her room and hid it in the back of her closet. She didn’t know why but a small voice in the back of her head warned her not to let anyone see her with the box|It was a masterful job how they managed to squeeze so many cars, at a hundred dollars a day, into this space. The Lexus approached, missing the back ends of cars on either side by inches.  The attendant held the door open for Bob and gave a slight bow as Bob slid behind the wheel. He accepted a generous tip and shut the door for Bob|"I think I'm smelling what you're cooking," Arriane said, climbing up a branch like a monkey to sit nestled in the oak tree.

"The Foundation will be sacrificed"-Dee frowned-

"but at least the Scale will make nice kindling."

"Hold on, how does the library get sacrificed?" Roland crossed his arms over his chest and looked down at Dee|Mr. MacDunlap, I take it you have convinced Mr. Dorn of the necessity of continuing the de Meister stories."

'Yes,' said MacDunlap.

'No,' said Graham.

'Don't mind him,' said MacDunlap. 'He's temperamental. You know these authors.'

'Don't mind him,' said Graham|He was enjoying this.

He braced her weight with his body and his other hand undid the belt of her jeans. Then he undid the button. Then he slid down the zip.

All the while he did this, he reminded her, "You said it's confusing. I'd like to know what's confusing|She'd had no choice, though: she couldn't possibly keep the fact that she was a vampire secret from her identical twin, Olivia, even if Olivia was human.

She and Olivia had only discovered each other at the beginning of the school year. They'd been separated at birth and adopted by different par- ents, so Ivy hadn't known that she had a twin until Olivia turned up at Franklin Grove Middle School. And it had been just as great a shock to Olivia|"For now," Circes acknowledged. "Just heed the warning, princess. Your mother felt it was important enough to send me here, so it must be important indeed."

I nodded. "You may tell my mother that I understand," I instructed. "But I do not understand why my mother did not come herself|'Well... there could be snakes in here with us.'

Agnes saw the rocks rush past, looked down and saw the foam of the swollen river.

The world spun around her when Vlad stopped in midair. Water washed over her toes.

'Let there be... lightness,' he said. 'You'd like to be as light as the air, wouldn't you, Agnes|I’ve long suspected that he keeps his house magically hidden from normal view, but I will have to reconsider the effect he is having on the Adventurers’ Academy and Bodaburg alike.”
“We agree,” Earl said. “He cast a very powerful flame spell at Dagdron and me before disappearing.”
The headmaster skimmed the pocket book a little longer before looking back up at Earl|He runs the small device over my stomach, and after a few seconds, the fast swoosh of our baby's heartbeat fills the room. Trevor holds my hand a little tighter, leaning closer to me so he has a clearer picture of the monitor.

"How does everything look?" Trevor asks, not taking his eyes away from the monitor|Sacha realised that something like that must have happened many times at the school.
But apart from Pip, Sacha realised he had few close friends.  There was his brother.  He knew that was a special relationship, one he would have for the rest of his life.  He was also a good friend with Jonathan, but not in a way that he could share confidences like he had with Pip|asked Katrina.
"Yes, it was just dust in your battery holder.  It was disrupting the charge, that's why it wouldn't work.  It's working now," said Sophie.
"Thanks, I'd hate to buy a new laptop right now.  I have way too much valuable stuff on this computer," said Katrina|"If you're saying what I think you're saying, you can totally thank us enough."

Eliza skewed her lips into a contemplation pucker. "That depends. What do you think I'm saying?" Mischief gleamed in her eyes.

Zuzana wrapped her hands lightly around Eliza's throat and mimed throttling her. "Tell. Us."

"I know another portal," said Eliza|"I'll handle it," Decker said, and glanced out the rear window.

Dani twisted in her seat to watch what could have been an instant replay of their first encounter with the other officer. The flashing lights on top of the cruiser were suddenly shut off and the car slowed and dropped away. When she could no longer see it anymore, Dani turned back to Decker|I bite my lower lip and raise an eyebrow at him as the other two guards come near us. 
“Did you find what you were looking for?” I ask. 
“No,” Gabe says, not taking his eyes away from mine. “Looks like we’ll have to search all of the other apartments until we do.” He finally turns to the other guards and instructs them to move on to the next apartment|It's going to be really hard to get someone in exactly the right place, and I'm the lightest," she said, citing the one scientifically verifiable - and thus relevant - piece of information we had.

"You don't have to prove anything, Lizzie. I can -"

"They need you, Cammie," she said, her voice no louder than a whisper. "And if their side needs you alive ... our side needs you alive." She looked up at the tall shelves and took a deep breath as if clearing all those unpleasant thoughts away and focusing on a single, quantifiable fact: "I'm the lightest|More light carriers were in various stages of completion, and the first heavy carrier, massing half a million tons, was just starting its two year construction phase. Defiant was built to carry a total of 34 smaller craft. While she was streamlined and capable of skimming gas giants herself, she would also carry four Mark 4 fuel shuttles, five personnel shuttles and 25 fighters. Her crew would total almost 500. Shiloh had already studied her specs, and he was impressed|Mother’s tone changed as well, to something a bit hard, “I’m aware of that, Ella. That is why I can’t help but wonder why neither Francie or Genevieve have much to say of you – meaning their daughters don’t have much to say of you. It seems they hardly know you.”
“Really.”
Mother stopped walking. Right there in the middle of the sidewalk, in front of a neighbor’s house, Mother stopped and turned to face Ella|"I keep telling you, I'm not hurt that badly. It's no worse than a football hit, and I get those all the time and keep playing. I have to beat you in a comp in two days."

I put my hands on my hips and looked up at him. "The comp is canceled because you're injured|Would Daniel still want me to be his wife? I wanted it more than anything.

Tears started to stream down my face.

"Melanie?" Erin leaned in closer, my hand still in hers. "You don't have to, you know. We can wait untillyou've healed."

"No, it's not that, Erin|He kisses her cheek before turning to watch Jay grind down the stairs again.

In turn, Lucy watches Colin, thinking of what Henry said in the auditorium. She puts her hand on her opposite forearm, feeling the swirling energy beneath. "How do you feel today?"

He glances at her and then back to Jay|“Excuse me?” Ella asked, “Open her? Do you mean the doll?”
“Please, do. And you can leave the ‘excuse me’ out of it. Soon you will come to realize that I am hardly civilized company.”
Ella felt a smile creep into the corners of her mouth and picked up the doll|"Solovet sent a team of guards in without warning. They had orders to take your mother to the Fount," said Howard. "There was nothing we could do."

"But why? Why? I'm staying. She knows I'm staying!" said Gregor.

"It can only be further insurance," said Howard|Some little lights were dancing in air, and Angell was beyond amazed. Both of them took a seat, on the crystalline lake’s sore, in which the moon was reflexing.
“Do you like it?”
“Mariuss, wow what a place!” Angell said astonished, taking a seat next to Mariuss|“You think he’s a stray?”
“I think he’s probably a farm dog that ran off. Got spooked by something maybe. He’s too…” Her words petered out. She felt bad talking unkindly about a fellow living creature that was already hurting.
Evan finished the sentence for her, “Too ugly to be a pet|Definitely no! Please believe me.”
“Why would Jacqueline think that you're going to marry her?” The whole situation still puzzled Eloisa to no end.
He shrugged. “I don't know.  I imagine that my uncle has something to do with it.  I feel nothing for her and everything for you, Eloisa|As Gregor mounted Ares's back, he saw the Bane's claws connect with a bat's wing and shred it like tissue paper. The bat and its rider plummeted straight down and were mobbed by a pack of smaller rats.

"Ares," Gregor began.

"I know. I will watch my wings," said Ares|Dean found some odd pleasure in this news that Harlin didn’t understand. Perhaps it was because of Winthrop’s lack of fortune on P324D. “I’m just glad it’s not us stuck this time,” Harlin said. “Jungles always mean bigger slunks, and more gata.”
“He also wants to pass on his congrats to you for a nice shot,” replied Dean|At home, the scent of evergreen mingled with ginger and spice, and multicolored lights glittered throughout the house. This was Harry Alderwood's favorite time of year. He'd settled in Leavenworth, Washington, more than five decades ago, and he loved the way this town celebrated Christmas. Despite his eighty-six years and failing health, nothing could dampen his love of the season|she asked, not looking at him.  
Patrick, himself unarmed, chose not to answer this question.  
“Don't do anything hasty -” he began.
“Quiet,” she silenced him.  Outside, Patrick could hear the unmistakable clomp of a horse’s steps outside the carriage.  Silently, Veronique slid to the far side of her seat and unlatched the door on the opposite side of the carriage|As he examined it he realized that it was a near duplicate of his own wards in this style. He altered the ward slightly but not in any way they would notice. He simply keyed the ward to allow him to pass through it. It would take a highly skilled wizard to notice the difference. He doubted that there was one here other than himself, unless they lived behind one of the other wards|It was when the cutters destroyed this field, and we didn't see it coming," said Lapblood.

"Maybe, but if you are wrong..." Nike trailed off.

"What are you thinking, Nike?" said Luxa.

"Perhaps, the cure still exists somewhere. Perhaps there is more starshade right here in the Vineyard," said Nike|I hadn’t expected there to be activities; usually when a guy takes a girl to a hotel it is for one thing and one thing only. I was motionless for several moments looking at Alex. Jillian and Gavin were wrapped in an embrace that made me look away.
“Don’t be nervous.” Alex whispered. “Go ahead.” He gestured to the door as Jillian finally pulled herself away from Gavin|The cage bars glowed blue and yellow as Haven and Bastian used their energies to heat the metal. They bent the bars back into their rightful places one at a time, as if the cage was made of molding clay.
They removed their hands and the cage bars cooled quickly, losing their glow and hardening into place.
“I’ll get Marius,” said Haven|I was angry now, truly angry. I'd worked hard to win that competition, and it did mean something. I slogged through the warm water and cold air, stopping right in front of him, my tummy only inches from his knees where he sat on the stairs. I said again, "Nick, you really think you could have beaten the first-place guy today if you'd only bothered to enter the competition|I was packing my things to escape when I heard you come through the door, I don't have much time," said the mugger looking around the kitchen.
"That door didn't make a sound, so how did you know I was here?" asked Michael.
"There are sensors attached to the doors and windows," said the mugger|Dwight was dumbfounded, but he asked the stranger in, and escorted him to the back of the store, where he and Rabbit had set up their living area. As soon as Rabbit saw the stranger, his eyes grew wide, and his skin became pale. Dwight could see that his young nephew was terrified.
“It’s alright Rabbit. He’s from the game company.”
The stranger looked at Rabbit, and turned to Dwight|"Wow, she's beautiful and she cooks!  I think I'll keep her."  Anne swatted him with a dish towel.  Michael opened cabinet doors until he found two plates. Then he looked in drawers until he found silverware, which he put on the table.  He pulled a coffee mug down, filled it and handed it to Anne|Sister Widona's words clang in my head like a great loud bell and I mentally kick myself that I did not think to ask just how deep that animosity went.

So what, then, do I tell her? Which is worse, being a daughter of Mortain or being some headstrong maiden who has behaved in a foolish manner? The uncomfortable thought occurs to me that I could be both|As they drew near the moat, Leland waved the men back, and they pulled aside, allowing the coach to move forward with Kay on one side, Eli on the other. The main doors of the curtain wall were pulled closed behind them as they passed into the bailey, and Kay was off her horse in a moment, running lightly up to the coach, pulling open its door.
Em blinked sleepily at the evening light, stretching wearily before taking Kay’s hand and descending out from the coach|"Now, I'll say it one last time before we call the police. It's late. We've got less than a week to pack Elle's things before we go home. We need to get back to bed. Please leave."

Carver's eyes shot daggers at him. Prentice simply returned his furious stare.

Carver broke contact and his gaze took in his daughter, top-to-toe, before he returned it to Prentice|The smell had become pretty strong, so John had sealed the area with polyurethane. The floor glowed beneath Karen's shoes. John let his eyes travel up as far as her calves, then he forced his gaze to The Painting.
"Aren't you going to ask me about Hank?" she said.
As if there were any possible reason to ask about Hank|Fran closed her eyes.
“Congratulations.  You know, I met Jamie’s fiancée at the party.  Gavin.  He’s a good man.”
“I suppose he is,” said Jean.
“He really liked you,” said Fran.
“Me?  He’s never even met me,” said Jean|The gun in her hand was smoking.  “I didn’t give you my real name when I moved into your apartments, Frank.  How did you find out who I am?”
“Look what you’ve done!” he said in a high-pitched whine, gesturing at the twin bullet holes.
“You’re avoiding my question, Frank|The strap still crossed her body but the purse itself was somewhere behind her.  She moved her hands behind herself as far as they would stretch, but found no purse.  Where had it gone?
She tried rolling to her right side, but the small trunk permitted little movement.  Pushing as far as she could, she extended her arms behind her body again searching for the purse|"I haven't actually seen it since the first day Lucas had his crew in."

"What?" Sandy peeled the paper off her lemon cupcake and took a bite. As she chewed, she asked, "Are you nuts? It's your kitchen. How can you not be curious about what they're doing in there?"

Nicole found the paper she was looking for and slid it across the table to Sandy|“People like who?” grunted Horace.
“House Leader Steinberg.”
“Him? And what kind of authority does he have? I want to hear from the top, Major. Get the President on the phone. Or even Pendergrass, for that matter. I want to hear them—”
“Shut up, Horace|Vo grabbed a cold bottle of water from the refrigerator. He looked at the dish rack full of wet plates, bowls and utensils. “Was Kim here?”
“Yes, she was. We were both sorry that you had to miss dinner, again.”
“I told you my schedule is erratic,” said Vo|After years of working to get her life on track, she finally had a decent job, a great husband, and the smartest, most beautiful baby boy ever born. He was only three weeks old, but she was certain he was destined for great things.

She could hardly wait to show Cory off to her friend Isabelle.

The doorbell rang five minutes early, but that was just like Isabelle|"And carols sung by the fire," Nicole adds.

"I'll drink to that," Agnes says, raising the cup to her lips.

A few moments of silence pass by before Agnes speaks again. "So how long are you planning on staying?"

Nicole's thrown off by the woman's question|I'd heard Norma insinuate that Hudson had been with Celia before. He'd dismissed it, saying she was as snowed as everyone, that he'd used the misconception to avoid Norma's advances.

Now that I'd seen the video, I wondered if there wasn't more to Norma's notion. "Why do you believe he was with Celia|I want to protest that Theo didn't pull me into this; given what I now understand about Triad's real agenda, and my abilities, I know I would have been involved sooner or later. Still, first things first. "Now all Theo has to do is figure out how to make another Firebird. You rebuilt the others, so you should be able to build one from scratch, right, Theo|“Thank you,” replied the Admiral, but before he could continue, Devorak had already nodded and begun on his way.
“Looks like he has everything under control,” remarked Anastasia from beside him as they wended their way to the airlock at which the transport was waiting. “But what are we supposed to do while we wait for the repairs?”
“Oh, I’m sure we’ll keep busy, Anastasia,” he said, entering the airlock|“He told me he’d received a letter signed by the YES kids this morning asking him to put a stop to the gatherings. The letter calls me ‘sacrilegious’. They really called me that.”
“That’s a lie. Did Steve sign it?”
“I don’t know. I didn’t get to see the letter|"Maybe," said Blake with a shrug.  "I was thinking of voting for him though.  He seems like a nice guy."
Trudy gaped at him in horror.  "You are NOT going to vote for that awful man!" she fairly screamed.
"Well, I think he's better than James Blooey," said Blake|In the movies they made it look so easy.

"You have a death grip on that thing," Wayne said, looking perfect and graceful on his feet.

"Okay, well, I don't actually skate. In fact I've never skated before." She felt her cheeks heating.

"You mean to tell me you've brought me on a date, and you can't even skate|My hand rests on the handle as I press my ear to the cool wood and listen in. The conversation is muffled, but I can still make it out.

Marcel slurs, "Sister Arianne, this is a surprise. It's a little late for you to make house calls, isn't it?"

Ari forces herself to sound flustered, "I apologize, Marcel|It was another squeezed-down crawlway, but this one seemed reasonably dry. They pushed along it until suddenly it ended and came out on a long, narrow ledge.  In front of them was a totally overwhelming space—an enormous, rock-lined amphitheater---hundreds of yards across Joel described it for Roke.
“Must be a giant sinkhole,” said Roke|Ann really wanted to get Alice to tell if she had bought her dress, and what it looked like.
Ann's wish was granted.  The conversation almost immediately turned to hair, makeup, and prom attire.  Ann got up to drop off her lunch tray.  As she walked by the girls finishing their lunches, Ann said, "Hello Alice|She stiffened a little. Jenna hadn't even considered that Nick might want to be drawn into their sons' lives. He wasn't the hearth-and-home kind of guy. He was the party man. The guy you dated, but didn't bring home to mom.

"You and I both know you don't have any interest in being a father, Nick|Martha thought she should begin with the simplest stuff, and then move on to the more difficult stuff.  And what was the simplest stuff?

`Alright kids,' began Martha Manning, `those of us who are adults need you kids to do some things.  So listen up.  Your life depends on it.'  Everyone had stopped talking and everyone was looking at Martha|"What do you do with yourself?"

"She's a bossy little thing. I hope you can tame her, Gabriel. Well, Ms. Grant, I'm a professional dominant, and I'm the man who will be opening an exclusive gentlemen's club here in CapeFalls."

Amy stared at him before returning her gaze to Gabriel|It hurt more than I thought it would, but less than having a manticore's teeth stuck in your arm. It healed in a week and when my mom asked what happened, I said I had been scratched by a cat.

"Do you need an antibiotic?" she asked.

I told her that I didn't think so. It wasn't anything dangerous and, besides, it was almost healed|Mercy attended to the arrangements with her usual efficiency, but everyone could tell that the joy that had reigned in her heart after the lawsuit was gone, but none of the residents, other than Sister Magdalene, had any idea why. 
The camera crew filmed the Community packing their meager belongings. They took pictures of Mercy on the phone talking to movers and diocesan officials. They interviewed some of the members of the Community|“Once that’s resolved, there’s no reason for me to be Zeke’s sidekick. I know he is just starting and needs one, so put me down as his for a few minutes only. Afterwards, I do still want to be one though. Do you know of anyone near here looking for a sidekick|Finally, I march across the cobblestone street, my boots splash in a puddle, and I pound firmly on the solid bronze door.
***
A fat, dull-silver-colored robot, about half my size, opens the door. Its tube-like arms block my entrance, but it hasn’t said anything, either.
I stare mutely before I realize it’s waiting for me to say something. Honestly, Rahda, this isn’t your first time looking at a robot|"You mean, it's a sweatshirt you stole and never gave back," he corrected.

It was one of the few things I had taken with me when I left home. I had been leaving the life we planned, but I'd still wanted some pieces of him. So, I'd granted myself pictures, my necklace, and this sweatshirt|Your ma has set up a scholarship in your name, Aidan. You know, Suzy left her savings to your rescue fund. Never put any out for leads on your whereabouts.”
“Why don’t you apply for it?” I asked.
“Don’t need the blunt,” he said carelessly. “What do you want to do, Aidan|The pen turned to black ash but the paper hit the floor of the cave as solidly as a rock.  As they waved their flashlights around, there was no sign the Serpent's Shadow.  The shadow tendrils were gone and the black liquid was gone.  There were also no more rocks on the floor either.
"So, we, um, won|The wall of fire he'd made protected their backs.

Cassie glanced over her shoulder, frantic. "Vaughn! Come with us!"

He stumbled to his feet. Tried to dodge the fire. His body was trembling, but he was coming toward her.

"You will come back to me, Cassie|She gently takes him by his shoulders, forcing him to face her, and she adjusts the angle of his tie the way she might straighten a picture on the wall. "I'm sure I don't need to tell you how important this gala is."

"You don't, but you will anyway|You are part of my first memorable encounters here. Really unforgettable that was. Cheerio.” He turned around and walked away.
Vo turned to look at Ana as well. His face had relaxed. 
“Ana,” said Vo, “it really didn’t matter.”
“It mattered to me,” said Ana|The guy is cool, unlike that tool Lenny, but when I moved in closer and found Maggie confiding in him, my veins fired up.

I scan the room and eye a bullhorn by the front door.

"Caleb, don't," Maggie says.

I ignore her as I cross the room and pick up the bullhorn|He sat beside her on the hospital bed and took her hand. "I'll miss you," he said.

"I'm so sorry I didn't come to North Dakota and sort things out in person," she said. "I took the coward's way out."

"Rose, whatever you are it's not a coward|On the other side, the bedroom opened into a very large bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub and European shower. Emily said, “This is my bathroom!”
Bev turned up her nose, “You can have it. I'm not much for tub-bathing.”
Paula said, “Don't tell me you've never been in a Jacuzzi|That left Noah and Gracie to check the yard, the garage, the tool shed, and the carriage house.
"She can't have gone very far," Gracie said. "We'll find her very soon."
"I should have seen this coming." Noah paced back and forth in front of Gracie|Never seen anything like it,” the doctor said while stroking his chin. “At this point, we’re going to have the surgeon open her up and repair any damaged organs and make sure there isn’t any internal bleeding.”
“Can I go with her?”
“I am afraid not. There just isn’t enough room in the ambulance|Our heat shields struggled to cope, but this ship survived better than the others, thanks to you. Your cloak dissipated much of the energy. We owe you our lives. The survivors are fortifying defenses on this ship against the planet’s indigenous population. This planet is desolate, only barely capable of sustaining life. The creatures here are not like us.”
He exchanged a strange look with Sorel and the ache lurking behind Nanto’s eyes increased|"Among other things, Genevieve's locket."

Amma nearly howled, holding her scarf over her nose. She clearly couldn't stand to even hear the word locket. "What about that thing? I told you I Bound it, and I told him to take it back to Greenbrier and bury it. It can't cause any harm if it's back in the ground|What if they were dead? It would be my fault.
I had barely any hope left for their survival when a carriage arrived by mid-evening. I did not imagine the two stepping out, alive and well, as my hopes of such had dwindles as the day wore on. I was astounded when I noticed who came out of the carriage|“I don’t have to,” said Stacie, obstinately, to herself.
“I’m never gonna be with him again and he didn't ever know who I was and why I invited him.  To my party and to sleep with him,” whined Yadira.
“Let’s get off this topic.  You know what?  I’m going to miss this town,” said Stacie|Or, maybe one of the small cottages is still in one piece. Would you handle that?"
Johnnie nodded.
Clint felt one weight slide off as another slid on. Johnnie would take good care of Jessie. There was no room for jealousy in him now. For that Clint was grateful. "I'll send Max down to check out Jessie|“No, Bean, I’m not. In fact, I’m going to burn it when we get back to the house.”

Horatius passed a stall with caged birds—pigeons, grouse, pheasants. Geese strutted in a small pen with a rope net over it to keep them in.
He pulled the tether and stopped the mule. “Good sir, do you have a white dove? Not yet a fledgling, preferably.”
“Aye,” said the man at the stall|she hugged me while Gabe shook Cuthbert’s hand. “Your dress is divine.”
“Thanks, you look amazing,” I said as Caycee shone in an emerald green dress. 
“You two are adorable,” my friend said, eyeing my date. Cuthbert smiled hugging me to his side. 
As Caycee dragged Gabe to the dance floor, I looked at Cuthbert|“I’ve roamed these parts for almost fifty years.  And yes, that story is real.  I have seen signs and heard things.   I am sure the Wampus Cat exists and I believe it stalks the the Blue Ridge.  I believe it may be the deadliest creature that ever roamed these mountains.”
We stood quiet for a second wondering about the mountains and if there really was a Wampus Cat|I wasn’t delusional enough to believe that news I’d gone on a date with the CEO would be something even the people I was closest to would be willing to keep to themselves, so I kept it to myself. 

Monday was as usual, a busy day. It was over before I knew it and as I was wrapping up and getting ready to go home I reached to turn off my computer. On impulse, I typed Aaron’s name into the company directory. There were job titles and short bios and a small photo of each of us in the company directory|What do they want?"

"To scare me." It seemed reasonable enough.

"Why would they want to scare you?"

Again, I didn't know.

"We need a diversion," I told Vee.

"Exactly what I was thinking," she said. "And we know I'm really good at diversions|"It's no secret you've been unhappy at school, and I'm relieved to see you planning for the future. You won't always be surrounded by cretins and knuckle-draggers."

Wow. A small spark of shame went through me. I hadn't realized they noticed my misery. But then, I stayed in my room, mostly|In a landscape of southern sunbathers, Luce's paleness had always made her feel self-conscious. But Cam's skin was so striking, so noticeable, almost metallic - and now she realized she might look the same to him. Her shoulders shivered and she felt a little dizzy.

"Are you cold?" he asked quietly.

When she met his eyes, she knew he knew she wasn't cold|Another groan caught my attention and I gasped as Kir wiped at a large gash on his arm. "Are you alright?" I made to rush towards him but Wolfe had turned back, grabbing my arm again to wrench me in the opposite direction. "Hey!" I growled at him, whipping back around to check on Kir|Maples and black walnut trees lined this street, and the air still had a morning hush. Elena watched her feet on the wet sidewalk, feeling suddenly uncertain. She didn't know how to start after all.

"So you still haven't told me about France," he said.

"Oh, it was great," said Elena|“We could turn on that big whirlpool bath and take a soak.” Seren took a quick whiff of the air. It seemed okay and she tossed the breather aside along with her coat.
“We are here to find something. Not indulge in luxuries.” Vain removed her turban and breather. “However, I do not believe that to be a luxury|"And who told you that?" asked Thorn.
"The Whitefingers," I admitted.
Thorn smiled indulgently. It was the exact same smile I had seen so often from the Gardeners in Sunday school when I gave them my best but still incorrect answer.
"Of course they did," said Thorn|Bonnie felt terrible. As she toed off her damp sneakers in the entryway of her and Zander's apartment, she sniffled experimentally. Maybe spending the afternoon at the river had given her a cold. That would be an easy explanation for the rotten, hollow sensation in her chest.

But, no, if Bonnie was honest with herself, she had to admit the feeling was guilt|"The witches have you that cowed?" he taunted, the stake held casually in his fingers as if he forgot he even held it. Dante was not stupid. The wizard hoped to rile his anger and give him the opportunity to strike. "Pathetic."

Dante shrugged. "It has nothing to do with the witches|"You don't really know me, Sing," I found myself saying. "I'm not a good person."

"Nonsense!" Sing said.

I leaned against the bars of the cell, glancing out - not that there was much to look at. A simple stone wall stood across from the cell. "You don't know the things I've done, Sing|"Oh yes," Jane said, her eyes lighting up with the first spark of interest since her arrival. "To start with, there is so much I'd want to change in this hall."

"What, in particular, would ye wish to change in my hall?" Connor asked, speaking slowly. Someone who knew him better would take heed from the dead-calm of his tone, but not Jane|“So much for building our own room!” he snarled, and lunged after his fleeing son.
Osgifu sighed, trying to replace her own disappointment with sympathy for nine-year-old Edric. She listened to the echoes of Godric’s yelling through the door as she hastened to pull on her own dress. “Best go easy on him, Godric|Ana noticed something in the sand and dug it out to show Vo. “Look!”
Vo took it over. It was an oyster the size of his palm. He opened it with a little force, and was greeted with something shiny inside.
“It’s a pearl!” said Ana. 
Vo took the pearl out of the oyster and gave it to Ana|“However, perhaps around the time of Doomba’s fall, Kotak could have been given a small dose of Doomba’s enormous power to keep himself healthy and active. A normal 75-year old man would hardly have been fit enough to even consider taking over a kingdom.” 
Juna slowly nodded, slightly relieved that, despite all of the trouble they were facing, they didn’t have to worry about Kotak being as powerful as Doomba|"We're not waiting until January when he's inaugurated," Yarber said. "In fact, we're not waiting until November to see if he wins."

"So you want to be released now?"

"Pretty damned quick;" Spicer said.

"Does it matter how you're released|Caroline seemed not to notice my disorientation and kept talking. “Today is very important. It’s very possible that we will solve the mystery, or at least a large part of it.”
“I understand that this was supposed to be a consolation?” 
“You’re funny,” she laughed. “Yeah, you can say it was a consolation|Like she'd timed him perfectly she was holding a tin plate piled high with powdered eggs, strips of beef jerky and slices of bread she'd probably toasted over the open fire.

Ridge couldn't have asked for a better breakfast. Smiling, he got to his feet and lifted his arms in a leisurely stretch. "I'm so hungry I could eat all of that plus the plate it's on."

Lani laughed. "The food, you can eat, but not the plate|I didn’t understand, “Axel!”  
“Please Lily let me get this out.  You can ask me any question you want when I finish”.  Now he was staring off into the distance, recalling some memory maybe. It gave me a second to gather myself.  I did not want to fall apart, not in front of Axel|You know I thought you were being serious just for a second there, Jason. But you must have had your fair share of the other.”
“Off and on, I’ve had my moments, for sure, but I won’t lie to you Bob. I’m no Casanova; not like some people will claim.”
“I know exactly what you mean, Jason|The reliquary was treated with a special reverence. Carefully maintained. Never opened, no matter what. Even if you inquired politely for a peek.

So one day I asked my Sunday school teacher what the big deal was.

He looked at me. Got serious.

That box contains the dust of the bones of saints|It was still dark out yet, but Henrik felt compelled to escape the horrible little house.  He threw what Reichsmarks he had onto the rickety wooden table and left.  He heard a train whistle in the distance and remembered what the old man had said about following the ghosts.  Was Esther waiting for him at the end of those tracks or had she already become one of those ghosts|Two Wolf Corps troopers with FG42s drawn appeared from behind a hidden door.  “Hands up!” one of them commanded in the same deep German voice they’d heard over the hidden speaker.  Neils and Henrik obeyed immediately.
A white-coated scientist stepped in front of the guards with a Geiger counter.  Henrik felt a sudden twinge of doubt and spared a quick glance at Neils|He will be smarter than that."

"And does Fellows know why Mr. Payne is pretending to be you?"

"The very question I asked." Mac cradled his head in his hands again and thoughtfully studied the canopy above them. "Only a madman would pretend to be me. I've been wishing for three years that I wasn't me|"We've already turned into your driveway twice, so that ought to account for our tracks," Margaret said. "With more snow falling, it'll be hard to read the tracks anyway."

I wondered what Martin had thought when he'd heard the truck, near the house. He'd probably thought help had come quicker than he'd expected. He'd have felt proud of me...

Instead, I'd been tricked, and I hadn't gotten help|"Glue yourself to Nicola's side," he ordered.

She pressed deeper into him and nodded again.

Cash continued. "I'll bring the police to you." His eyes turned to Fenella. "Nicola needs to do something, you get Abby off the castle grounds immediately."

Fenella replied instantly, "Yes, Cash|“I felt rather useless,” Two explained to Old Man Tales.
“Why?”
“Well, don’t you think I’m just sort of an extra in the world?”
“No. You’re an individual. What more can anyone be?”
“Some people have a purpose,” said Two|'The next item - the allotments by the roadworks on the A90. Jock - you were looking into an application under the Sites of Special Scientific Interest scheme.'
'Bad news, I'm afraid, Chris,' said Jock, beaming with satisfaction. 'The scheme's past its closing date for this year.'
'I'm not very pleased about that, Jock|Gloria said yes to everything but croutons and given the choice of Caesar, creamy pepper, and honey-walnut vinaigrette dressing, she chose Caesar.
Rick’s asked for vinaigrette dressing, croutons and no bay shrimp.  The rest of the salad was the same as Gloria’s.
“That was an exercise in rapid fire decisions,” said Gloria|Hang it wherever you like," Miranda said, brushing her hands in exasperation.

"That's exactly what I intend to do."

Miranda sighed and, ignoring Will, said, "Have you ever noticed how important it is to the fragile male ego to have the last word?"

Shirley tried to disguise a smile, but Will obviously wasn't amused|I joined Mark, Tony, and his son back in the crowd as the event started. I wanted to catch Yegor’s match before I got ready for my debut. He was wrestling first; there were only four matches on the card. 
Minutes after I got seated the lights dimmed. That cold music filled with horns played. It was Yegor’s time to come to the ring|Ten minutes ago, she'd still felt that way-and now all of a sudden she was flying to Vegas to marry Bobby Polgar, a man she'd seen a grand total of three times in her life. She hadn't even slept with him, and she was about to marry him.

"Did I agree to this?" she asked tentatively.

"You want to marry me and I want to marry you." Apparently that seemed an unquestionable fact to him, so he'd taken the next logical step-they were on their way to Vegas|Neb giggled again at his own silliness, leaned forwards and shouted, ‘Balkind, drop!’ He heard a thump, followed by an ‘oomph,’ and leaned sideways to peer down at the ground. Blain lay spread eagled in the mud with the child splurged face down over his stomach. As Neb watched, Lydia, Lillian and a few other women streamed towards Blain and Luke, both struggling to extract themselves from the mud|Not until he knew English better than the English.
He was going back to settle things; or at least, that is what he had told Soren and Ann-Marie. In his heart, however, he knew he was going back to stay. Without Barbro there was nothing for him in Stockholm. Without writing there was nothing for him in life, and his writing—he was sure—had, like Conrad’s, like Flannery’s, to be in English|As they began to leave the servant approached them again.
“A suite has been prepared for you to stay in tonight,” the woman said. “A carriage will take you to Rollan’s home in the morning to meet with the rest of your group.”
They said goodbye to their family and followed the servant|Paige heard Chris’s bare feet slapping on the concrete as she crossed the room.  Chris entered the candle’s circle of light, turned, and slid her bottom up on one end of the desk.  She saw Chris held a smallish round object in her hands.  Chris put the object down and picked up the candle|We're at a game."

"And anything can happen at a game, right Dad?"

"Yep. That's the way it goes." He points out to the field. "Let's see if Wilson can hit a home run."

Liam snorts. "He hasn't hit a home run ever in his life, Dad|An officer followed by six soldiers, all in full dress uniform emerged, marching crisply, and stood at attention each side of the coffin. The officer, facing forward, stood at the head of the coffin. He made a swift 180 degree turn to face the coffin; his right arm snapping to his brow in a long held salute. He snapped his arm back to his side, and swiftly returned to face away from the coffin|'I have a schedule arranged,' Himmel said, after an agonized pause. 'I pay a half cent apiece for Lazy Brown Dog rejects, twice what they're worth, so the company's making a profit. So why should anyone object?' His voice rose to a squeak.

Pondering him, Jonas said, 'No one's objecting|Laura had often dreamed of Joshua falling in love with her, and the best part of her brother’s band was that Joshua came to her house often. Even though she typically didn’t talk to him at all, the thought of him being in her house was exciting. A few years back, Jack had been furious with Laura – he’d found out she had a crush on Joshua|He had gotten Hereward exiled, and thus made an intimidating example of him. Richard would be pleased.
“Yes. So they did.” Hereward reached out and grabbed the top of Godric’s hair. He twisted the strands and forced Godric to look at him. “I’m an outlaw. I suppose that means I can do whatever I want now and it won’t make much difference, eh, Godric|Not when your heart so irrevocably belongs to him." Hunter sighed and pushed away from his seat, he walked in front of the large window.

Isabelle watched his taut muscles flex and stretch beneath his fitted jacket. Lifting a hand to his head, he rubbed then cursed. "It is not my story to tell, Isabelle|It is just a precaution, but I would feel better knowing they are all together and safe.”
Stephen did not hesitate. “Right away, Kay,” he agreed, and he was off running down the stairs, heading into the main doors.
Leland did not take his eyes off the tent. “Do you have an idea of what is going on in there, Kay|I stuck the second one over my lips and licked at it the same way Mr. Crepsley had.

The lights went down and everybody settled back into their seats. Gertha Teeth was next up. She was a big woman with thick legs, thick arms, a thick neck, and a thick head.

"Ladies and gentlemen, I am Gertha Teeth|“He did give her makeup to cover the bruise so she could rejoin the dinner. You can ask Sophie; she applied it.” 
They walked in silence for a moment as he digested all of this information. Miss Bingley seemed to have returned to her proper girly self. Was she playing with him? She definitely was, but he could not tell which half was doing the playing|It could be conjured to hand, but it had to come from somewhere. Material still had to be woven, bread still had to be baked, vegetables grown, feed animals slaughtered.
  "Mistress Tyana," he called. "Can you spare a minute?"
  "For you, Nasom, I can spare an hour if you need it," replied Tyana|Who had loved and always would love you—“
Setzer’s grip had tightened on the cards as she spoke, and when he had slowly turned the last . . . Ace of Diamonds. Queen of Hearts. He threw them to the floor with a glare, interrupting Maria with a growl of “Stop! Stop, do you hear? Enough!” His flashing eyes raised to Maria’s yellow face. A stricken expression glazed her eyes. “Why didn’t you tell me, Maria|“The dancing was so-so, but you sure know how to make a girl laugh,” said Ana. 
McKenzie excused himself to go to the bar. Ana asked Vo if he wanted to dance.
“We should probably get going,” said Vo.
“Wait till the break? I want to wish my daughter a happy birthday,” said Ana|And the rest of the story is: We love and we feel and we try and we hope.

I can't help it-I find Sammy's new third-grade classroom and peek in through the window. I see him at his desk, doing something with pipe cleaners. He isn't smiling-instead he's concentrating in that complete, unembarrassed way that kids have. I stay there for a minute or two, watching|That you rummaged in your apartment for something, called Tom, and left,” I said.
“That’s right I did.  But I don’t remember what had frightened me,” said Rachel.
“What class was it?”
“Huh?”
“You’re night class.  What was it?”
“It was that video editing class with Professor Vincent,” replied Rachel|Most of the pictures were mounted on glass partitions that created a sort of maze through the little place.
There was one security guard in the gallery.  He didn’t look as bored as security guards usually looked.  There was also a nicely dressed Japanese host who must be one of the Tanaka brothers.  At one point she saw him disappear into a white door in the white wall at the back of the gallery|As a team, they’d organised themselves into an efficient search party for previous clues, and as a team they were able to strengthen their efficiency for this particular search. The intimidating task that lay before them could, in effect, be divided by three, as they each acknowledged the participation of the others. Their early start meant that they could feasibly spend up to fourteen hours that day, searching|"So, what's the menu?"

She frowned, probably wondering why his tone had shifted so abruptly. But a moment later, she seemed to push aside any misgivings and said, "We're making steak quesadillas, Mexican rice and roasted asparagus."

"Well, you had me up until the asparagus|The poor thing was lying on her belly, probably the last position a bat would choose to rest in, with one wing extended at a grotesque angle. Her eyes had a dull, remote expression that Gregor had never seen in them. He hoped it was just from the pain medicine.

"She has dislocated the wing," said Hamnet with a frown. "How long has it been out of the socket|Additionally, he would like for you to know that he is prepared to appoint you to your father's seat in the US Senate, as this authority has just been vested in him by the state legislature."

I'm beginning to realize how the McCoys could hate these snakes so much. Henry Hatfield is the nephew of Devil Hatfield, the leader of the infamous Hatfield Clan. The governor can't run for a second term. He had himself set up for that US Senate seat two years ago, but the states ratified the Seventeenth Amendment the year before, allowing for direct election of US Senators, yanking the power away from the corrupt state legislatures and manipulators like Hatfield|He’d thought of little else since returning from his eleven o’clock class, and he didn’t even know if there was anything to be learned from it.  Yet each time he walked away, he soon found himself back at his desk, staring again at the box.  
It was a ten-inch cube with no apparent seam to indicate a lid and no visible hinges.  He had turned it over and over in his hands and could not determine how it was supposed to open|Abozi paused, collected his thoughts, and replied evenly, 'I mean that Kainar is a worthy opponent. That is all.'
Sharma propped himself into a sitting position, coughed, and wiped his forehead. Jina could see that he was getting irritated. Since he defeated Vaxili, Sharma had only known success and promises of future glory. Nowadays, he became impatient with cautious talk even when they were discussing a foe as redoubtable as Kainar|39

I had nothing to do with this, Anders," Peter said. He had recovered himself, but his face was still pale and wretched, his eyes a deeper blue than the old judge-General had ever seen them.

"The box is yours, then?"

"Yes."

"Why did you deny that you had such a box|When was the last time you slept?"

His expression is unreadable in the shadow, but it isn't so dark that I can't see how his shoulders seem too heavy for his frame, how tired he looks "You don't want me to touch you, too? I come on your lips and you're ready for sleep|Their names were legally changed to Ken Goodspeed for the duration of the contract, which prevented Duke from having to learn hundreds of new names every month — a feat which Duke, the sole field operative for Secret Headquarters and the product of an experimental program to create the world’s manliest action hero, was ill-equipped to manage.  While he was impossibly fearless, impossibly strong, and impossibly manly, Duke Manfist was not terribly bright.
“I know a narrator who’s gonna get punched if he doesn’t stop calling me dumb,” said Duke|Everything we've seen this time is just like it was last time, and it was the Troll-Gods then, wasn't it?'

'I'm not even positive about that any more.'

'Well, something had to have enough authority over the Trolls to make them migrate from Thalesia to the north coast of Atan.'

'Just how smart do you have to be in order to be a Troll|The cars had come back, the neighborhood had rose back, and I stayed there in the middle of the road, lying next to my friend who had just lost his life, and I cried like I never had before. 
 Oh Zorro, what have you done to me. I remember the very first day that I saw you, there, at the vet. You were no larger than the palm of my hand but I saw something in you that told me about your past, about what you had gone through, about your bravery – and that’s why I called you Zorro|Simon and Will were nearly the same height, but they looked like night and day. Simon had dark hair and green eyes and the most infectious smile in the world. A few girls who walked by gave him the once over, and it was clear that they liked what they saw.

Girls were always coming on to Simon, almost as much as they did to Will|Mikhail turned away to keep the couple from seeing the laughter in his eyes. Raven's idea of having the Carpathians cook dinner for the guests at the inn was turning out to be more fun than he had anticipated. "Raven and I are more than happy to lend you one of our houses. We hope you are able to stay for a long visit and maybe look upon this place as your home when you are not traveling|"You see, Promander," said Lystus, "that's what you get for providing drinks for the likes of us. Forgotten before the night was out."
"I imagine that depends on the drinks," said Promander. His gaze flickered toward Lexia for what was a second too long. "The tamers make for a very chaotic atmosphere."
"It's a way to relax," said Lystus|The one where he cried himself to sleep. I always waited for that comedown to happen again, but it never did.

He wasn't always violent. That night, he was. He'd slammed me into the wall as he'd left his apartment and sprained my wrist. Mom and Dad had been away on a business meeting in Boston, so when I arrived home, I was free to cry|The truth is I do need to talk to Lark. And you need to listen to what I have to say." Nita turned and gazed up at Stone, who had not taken a seat. He stood in the archway, his shoulder propping up the wall, his arms folded across his chest. "Don't you want to sit, Stone|Hurrying to leave before the changing of the guards, I took the two files, along with the guard's body, returning to my access vent, where I encountered a serious problem. An absent guard is quite a different thing than a dead guard. The guard had to come with me. Unfortunately, his body would not fit into the vent|"A sister."

"But not a twin sister?"

"No!"

"Where is she?"

"She stayed with my mother."

"How old were you when your parents separated?"

"Can you be sure she wasn't your twin|“Yes.” I replied. He extended his hand.
“Mr. Dawsley.” he said. I shook his hand and looked at my other hand, anticipating the bottle of wine to be in it. I had forgotten that the small woman had taken it from me.
“I had a bottle of wine for you, Mr. Dawsley|I just didn’t like that “what’s-the-point” gaze in his eyes, and it was becoming more frequent.
“What’s up?”
“Sometimes I get tired of it.”
“Of what? School? Who doesn’t get tired of school.”
“No, you know I don’t mind school|She moved her body against his, soft and pliable, her arms clasped around him. A whole summer’s worth of lightning flickered and flashed through Jina while the thunder rumbled through his ears and his temples. He tried to fight the storm down and mumbled dry-lipped, ‘I don’t know! I just don’t know.’
Still pressed against him, Dana said softly, ‘Think what it could mean to you, Jina|With all the extra work as of late, she'd never told Tara about the projects he'd hired her for.

He grabbed the nearest decanter, whiskey, and looked at her. "I've told you, we have no legal recourse. Let it go."

From across the room, Cecily pretzeled her arms in front of her and stared at Conrad|A sorrowful moan came from inside the gathering hall as Alyssa pulled Samantha toward the far end of the building. A chill ran through her at the thought of what was happening inside the sanctuary as a scream of desperation filled the air. The elders were totally committed, now was the perfect time. Ritual night was the only time they brought the dogs in from the perimeter and took them into the sanctuary|Their nostrils flared as they sniffed the air, heading right toward her and Logan.

He grabbed her wrist, ripping her hand away from his wound, and pulled her toward Nicholas. Another two of those furry things were lunging at him, jaws snapping. Three more lay dead at his feet.

"What's the time frame?" asked Michael.
The mugger looked around the kitchen. "I had one day to do the job.  If I failed, someone else would come," said the mugger|Over coffee and cake, Quinn said, "I have plans for us for tomorrow afternoon."

"Plans to do what?"

"It's a surprise." He sipped the last of his coffee and added, "A romantic surprise."

Quinn read the emotions warring on Libby's face. The need to question him further. The disbelief of his casual use of the word "romantic|Something was happening between Zach and a little blond woman, but there wasn't enough information from either of their memories to put together what it was. Drake grabbed Helen. She fought back and finally freed herself. Drake collapsed in pain and Logan quickly pulled away from the sensation before it could overwhelm him. Logan tuned the pain out and concentrated on Helen|"He asked me to talk to you," Lynn was saying.

"Who did?" Ruth asked distractedly. She was dying to open the mailbox, but she wanted to do it in privacy.

Suddenly Ruth understood. She looked away from the mailbox and focused her attention on Lynn|“Everything that comes from the Empress is powerful and can be used when needed.”
Claire looked at the pouch with uncertainly.  “But how will I know when I need it or even how to use it?”

	Manton shouted, ‘Come in, Jenkins|But, yes, I see what you mean. Regardless, I will not put myself in a position where I must fight him again. It wouldn't be gentlemanly in this situation."

Matt’s first impressions were what Sarah had said – Jeans meeting an expensive designer suit.  He smiled and reached out his hand to shake Robert’s.

“I know who you are and it’s nice to meet you, Matt|I cooed to her and rocked her, but she just wouldn't sleep. She was so restless.

Will stepped out of the car. “Yeah, this year is going to be great,” he said as he closed the door and looked up at the building in front of them.  
Unlike Charlie, Will didn’t ever seem to have a problem with school|She also saw some old stuffed animals sitting over in the corner.  Those must be remnants from his early childhood he wasn’t quite ready to part with.
On his bedside table, however, she saw a wooden cup.  It was tall and cylindrical in shape.

The original paint had been blasted away, leaving a dull gray primer. She had no wheels, no insignia, and no interior. The hood scoop had mice nesting in it. The grill was full of straw.

She pretended not to know what I was talking about.

Not all Mortal girls. Look-

Ridley grabbed Link's arm, jerking him away from Savannah|“And, there is nothing wrong with her. She’s perfectly healthy.”
“So, there is nothing wrong with her,” said Charles, regretting it the moment he saw Melissa’s reaction. He didn’t want to show his hand.

She didn't say that, though, just moved a little closer to Bonnie, as if she could shelter in her friend's warmth.

Alvar nodded and began to focus on his emotions|The only decision you ever have to make is what dessert you’re gonna take back to your office so you can spoil your appetite for supper !”
“ Now Kate, be nice or I’ll go some place else.”
“Sure you will. You know as well as I do that I’m the only place in town where you can get a Rueben.”
“ You know me too well, Kate|He shook his head sadly as he tied the balloons to her bedpost. "A hospital without a single 'get-well-soon' balloon in sight. Craziness."

"Thank you for them anyway. They always brighten up a room."

"I remember you saying that when you talked about a friend's tenth birthday party. You wanted some for your own..." but she hadn't even had a party that year, much less balloons|It was a swift downward spiral of thought, making my mortification worse and worse and, presumably, easier for Kiyu to pick up on.
"So… Diesel will know?" I asked, desperately trying to think of something else.
"Absolutely. Dogs are very sensitive. They're almost always yins," said Kiyu|Hmm, they either already knew or they didn't want to find out.

Mason and Cooper didn't reach for the glasses though, only the lemons. They put them skin side into their mouths then reached for the shot glass and pulled the girls back to their laps. At the same time they poured the shots in the girl's mouths and then bent down and gave them the lemons|Even though the kid was probably all talk and wouldn’t have done it, Logan didn’t trust him anymore and was glad to see the back of him. But he did hope Sid found his girlfriend. There wasn’t much else to live for in the world. 
Jack reached to his belt and un-holstered a 9 millimeter handgun, the same sort Lizzie had been carrying around, and handed it to Logan|When she tipped it over above the pile of herbs, it trickled out, leaving a thick film inside the vial.

"Don't use it all," Elena breathed, hanging over Bonnie's shoulder. "What if we need to do it again?"

"I don't want to make the herbs too wet, anyway," Bonnie told her, capping the vial|"Oh he got that installed a few years back now."

"That son-of-a-bitch!"

"Hey!" Gaia grumbled from the bed. "I take offence to that. Especially since, if it weren't for me, your life would be very dull right about now."

Her daughter, Artemis snorted, "It is dull|Stop shutting your minds to me and tell me everyone who has been in touch with you."

If Lucien hadn't been so shocked by her line of questioning he would have pounced at her (an idiotic mistake since the Plexiglas was magikally electrified). His frown of deep concern was unmistakable. "You mean you don't have her?"

"Don't play games with me, Lucien|This was followed by ghostly bagpipes, and a few mournful Scottish voices singing, "How much is that doggeee in the window; the one with the waggely tail...." 
Macklin was staring in horror at a spectral haggis, when Polydoor broke into his reverie.
"What are you looking at?" the acolyte snarled.
Suddenly Macklin realized the spectral haggis had been superimposed on Polydoor's hump.
"Like my hump, do you?" Polydoor whispered.
"Yes I do, very much," said Macklin|I should have been more worried about his skull, but I laughed.

"You just...keep your hands to yourself. I'll take care of it." He rubbed his head.

"Poor baby," I said, getting up on my elbows and feeling the top of his head gently. Yup, he was definitely going to have a bump|She bit down hard on her lower lip. A single tear trickled down Izzy's flushed pink cheek. Just one.

Annie understood. It was what she'd been hoping for, at least in part. That Izzy would see herself as she used to be. "I bet you always used to look like this, didn't you, Izzy|Do you really like Neal?”
	“I gotta work now.”
	“I’m your only customer.”
	“Then buy something and I’ll ring you up.”
	“You’re not busy.”
	“That's a matter of perspective.”
	“So in your perspective, you are busy|He had been pretty upset, but he wasn’t now. Now he felt... Well, at peace.
“That's good, Paul. You should feel at peace.”
“It feels good,” he said. It seemed entirely normal that whoever was behind him could read his mind... Am I dead?
“I wanted to talk to you about how you got here, Paul|But soon after her marriage to the wealthy Greg, she had dropped all her ambitions and devoted her time to the “good life.” Greg was lenient toward everything she did. He kept busy with his inherited company, the family finances, and new deals. 
Barbara wouldn’t find it boring to spend a few days with her and Greg|"There is a scent trail."

"Again with your sense of smell. That's not normal, you know."

"No, it's not. But it is useful." He shut her door and went around to his side. The van's engine started smoothly. He turned to ask her how to get to her home and saw her staring in the back of his van|Thinking about gingerbread houses made my stomach rumble, so I slid off my stool and went over to the cake stand sitting in the middle of the counter. I'd helped Fletcher make

some sugar cookies earlier. There were only five left, and I

knew that he wouldn't mind me eating them.

I lifted the glass top, set it aside, and grabbed one of the cookies|I could tell she’d been dead a long time.”
“Two bodies in one night. Two bodies out there—probably the only two unaccounted for bodies within a fifteen mile radius of here—and you found them both last night. You hit the jackpot didn't you, Mulligan?”
“I wouldn't call it a jackpot|"This isn't about me, Penny. It's about you. You do too much."

"How much is too much?" she argued, feeling the need to defend the way she lived her life. "I have two babies to take care of."

"Yeah," he muttered thickly, "I know, but you should have help|He probably ought to be annoyed with her, but he was much too intrigued by what drove this firebrand of a girl, and how she had got here?
 	He’d been on the run from the Galactic Union for eight weeks now, since he’d been framed by the damned Ziloni. He’d found a nice little hideout back on Earth, where no one was aware of the existence of the Union|“I don’t know Grandmother because I always pick up my room at night.”
Her grandmother smiled and decided to ask another question. “Kaya, what would happen if a Wanderer forgot to take water into the desert when she left the village?”
Kaya thought about that as the comb stroked through her long hair. “I think she would be sorry that she didn’t have any water|“You had the authority of your service to His Majesty, King Sonnagh, to protect you.

It felt slightly less sunny out here. "I hope by that girl you are referring to my car."

"The Internet loves the idea that you're dating someone.

They want to know if she's the one, Cole|Rachel leans against the counter while I load the dishwasher.

She watches me do my best to ignore her. She doesn’t realize

she’s everywhere. She’s in everything. Every single thing has

just become Rachel.

It’s consuming me.

My thoughts aren’t thoughts anymore.

My thoughts are Rachel.

I can’t fall in love with you, Rachel|“This is great,” said Greg, “Now we can take it to the cops.”
“And say what, exactly?  That I broke into his office and illegally got this?  I want more evidence.  So far all I’ve got is assumptions and circumstantial stuff.”
“You sound like a regular lawyer,” said Greg|Sam asks, moving the ladder he holds to his side and out of the way.
“Sorry, I was following a guy,” I tell him peering in both directions. “Which way did he go?”
“What guy?”
“The guy who just came out this aisle,” I respond, impatiently.
Sam gives me an odd look, “No one came out of this aisle|“Someone might have got lost and called for a helicopter,” Hollie suggested.
“I don’t think so, this is a Greek footprint,” Jordan told.
“How do you know?” Broudie questioned, amazed.
“Because of that.” Jordan pointed to a small ball next to one of the footprints|"I used to be into the intellectual type."

"You wouldn't know it from the guy she dated last year," Raquel said.

"I can imagine." Dana smirked. I knew she wouldn't be able to resist teasing Lucas about that later.

I jumped in with, "What about you, Dana|- and all those other places we went to when we were jumping around to confuse the other side? You tell Bhelliom where we want to go and then I'll tell it to do it.'

'We can't be sure that I'll always be available, Sparhawk. There are times when I have to be away|Later, I coaxed Sub-Commandante Fischbein’s mother, now a retired psychiatric nurse, over to the Olive District for coffee at Rough Roast (216 S. Alcalde St.), which reputedly serves the strongest shade-grown, Fair Trade java, anywhere, or your money back. Bismuth tablets are free to paying customers. Marie Fischbein was sanguine about her son’s crusade. I had seen her on TV and wanted to chat further to gain some insights.
“What can I say? I was a smart-alecky Jewish-Italian girl from Long Island," began Marie|"Me too," said Forrest, a man with no exceptions.

"How'd you do?" Forrest asked.

"I won a couple of thousand at blackjack. They comped me a room."

"I paid for that damned room," Harry Rex said. "Probably the whole floor."

"I love their free drinks," said Forrest|Then he grabbed the robe, said tersely, "Where?" and was out the door, with Titian at his heels, before Surreal could gather her wits.

By the time she caught up to them, Titian was questing back and forth in the corridor like a hound searching for a scent while Saetan prowled more slowly. Neither of them paid any attention to her arrival|“Don’t you feel proud of what you did?”
“Er, sure,” Carlos said and smiled. He handed the clipboard back and the manager smiled as well, all well with the world. “But I think I can do better. That wasn’t the peak of my achievements here.”
“That’s the spirit,” the manager said and patted his back with the clipboard|Compared to the huge dome and lodges nearby it was a very small building, but there were many solar panels arrayed nearby to provide power to it. Indeed half the solar panels of the Reservation had been relocated to power the new building. What could be so important and urgent?
He carefully studied everyone who came and went, looking for Green. He identified only four white-skinned people, but none of them were Green|I apologize for the awkward moment back in the VIP lounge."

In spite of the lack of listening devices, she appreciated that he kept his comment vague with all the people around. However, she also knew this was about as much privacy as they would get for the next couple of days. "I guess there's no need for me to say, 'What moment|As far as being confident...  Well, it was obvious that he wasn’t sure of himself.  Maybe that was part of his problem.  If he had the same confidence that Peter did, maybe he’d handle himself better.
Peter turned and saw her.  A wide smile lit up his face.  “Jessie, you’re certainly beautiful this morning.”
“You mean there are mornings when I’m not beautiful|Sharma grunted and said, 'Watch this, Jina.' He whirled the sling and let fly. Plink! The pebble hit the wall leaving the targets unscathed. He let fly again with the same result. Finally, after eight attempts, he had hit only two targets. Sharma said gruffly, 'You see how it is with me, Jina|It was a failure of friendship."

I thought about me and Cole. Were we friends? Or was it just infatuation?

I felt Sofia lay her head on my back and then sigh. She must've looked sad, because her father looked sad, too. He said, "Only marry your best friend, Sofia|All her life, Mother had looked at least ten years younger than her real age, due to good genes and a healthy lifestyle. Her hair had given up its dark brilliance and was now white. She seemed smaller overall and slightly stooped. In a guilty rush of adrenaline, Beth considered turning around and leaving before Mother saw her. She didn’t know if she could handle the reunion.
Before she could move, Niklas spied her and yelled, “Beth|"Even though I'm not...normal?"

He chuckled at that, and some of the tension she'd sensed in him seemed to ease. "Normal means common," he told her. "It's ordinary. It's routine. It's predictable. It's boring. Why would anyone fall in love with normal|"But we'll know now, and we've waited so long. It'll be such a delight to know why all of us are here. Don't you think so, Mr. Morley? I mean, wouldn't it be wonderful for all of us to know our purpose?"

"Yes," he said.

"So you do agree with me, Mr. Morley|Joe turned off the stove. “I’ll drive around the neighborhood and look for him.”
“I’m going with you,” Beth said. 
Joe drove in silence, scanning the neighborhood for Nik or his blue bike. Finally, he stopped the car and turned to her. “You spend a lot of time with Nik|"You're moving in with me immediately. We'll be married this weekend."

She stepped back even as he moved to take her into his arms again. "I'm graduating this weekend."

“Why?”

“No. You’re an individual. What more can anyone be?”
“Some people have a purpose,” said Two.
“My boy, being an individual is the only purpose|Wren was dying.

Dante frowned. "You're ... dead ..."

"No, I'm not. It took me a good century to heal from my burns and to look normal again, but I'm very much not dead." She smiled at him. "You won't be able to say the same soon|Jesse listened, still dangling off the edge of the pillar, but he only heard a breeze in the desert, and an eerie chorus of crickets.
Though he heard nothing, Ashton muttered, “A train is coming.”
Ashton held out his hand and Jesse took it instinctively. He pulled him up easily, then his hold dropped to his sides as he stepped out further onto the edge of the top of the pillar|And so these construction workers discovered the Scroll - among other things - and they turned it over to the local museum. Well, the museum took it and upon realizing what it was, called in the experts.”
“Who are the experts?”
“Archaeologists, medieval historians, et cetera.”
“Okay. And what did the experts do with the Scroll|Ion held his hand out, and Jedius placed what looked like a large, disfigured, fang like object on his outstretched palm. 

“What the heck is this?” he asked, looking at the strangely shaped fang. 

“Nothing more than a token.” said Jedius, smiling. “A token to remind you of me, and everything I’ve taught you.”

Ion was intrigued at the choice Jedius had made for a token|He could remove the gag, let her talk, let her scream. No one would hear her screams here.

No one ever heard the screams here.

In silence, he crossed to Lily's side.

His fingers trailed over her cheek.

She jerked back, shuddering. More grunts. Moans.

He shook his head. "You have a lot to learn, Lily|"It's just fine."

Ramsey pulled her out onto the dance floor. She was a good dancer, clearly trained in some way. It would account for the way her body was built, and right now he was getting a pretty good grasp on what her body was like. They moved together really well, and soon even he was forgetting what he was going to do later|I handed the phone back to Erik. I'd call her again in the morning, tell her that I had the car, and then meet her somewhere and give it back. Although, how I'd explain that to my parents, I didn't know.

"You never answered my question," I said to Erik|Mike asked, only half interested in knowing the final truth, and the other half fearing it.
“Yall won’t like to hear it.”

THE DETECTIVE WAS right. Thankfully, he left them shortly after delivering the news, allowing them some time to think over the implications and debate with each other about what to do next.
“I just can’t believe it, Mike|Seth crawled back to the edge and I joined him. We peered over and I spotted a bunch of monsters stomping their way across the hills. Seriously, do these guys know how to walk?
“Great,” Seth hissed under his breath. “Company for us.”
“Whoo…” I mumbled.
He rolled his eyes and shifted his gaze back to the monsters|"If you ask me, Lucas was not-lying. His words weren't exactly false, but for someone who wants our help, the boy isn't really what you would call forthcoming."

Lucas hadn't ever explicitly said that the people after him weren't a threat. He'd never said that they weren't dangerous|Even with the fondness she had developed for the Skoda, Claire still shuddered as she opened creaking doors to be greeted by the stink of stale smoke and overpowering air fresheners. 
She climbed inside the least awful car and flinched as her hands touched the sticky seats. Quickly climbing out, Claire smoothed the grimace off her face and turned back to the salesman.
“Is this all you’ve got?”
He nodded, all his exuberance gone as he realised he was unlikely to make a sale|"Please don't throw any more mud at me," pleaded Tristran. "Look. I didn't mean to disturb you. It's just there's a star fallen somewhere around here, and I have to get it back before the candle burns out."

"I broke my leg," said the young lady.

"I'm sorry, of course," said Tristran|Everyone carries a guitar and writes songs. It’s lonely, but I don’t want to go home. When I turn eighteen, maybe I can visit you in Marine. I can meet your friends. Another life as brothers. Around and around, like a circle. If The Church taught me anything, it is patience|He had a pack slung over the arm that was not using his crutch. His face was flushed and his breathing audible. The exertion of moving around the palace had taken its toll on him.

"Hey, Mareth. Here, sit down," said Gregor. He made a space on the couch for the soldier.

"Perhaps for just a moment," said Mareth|Mick grabbed the three trunks from the rack on the back of the buggy and threw them, one after the other, onto the porch with no more difficulty than if he were tossing feather pillows. He also unloaded several longer cases. Violet assumed they contained long guns—rifles and shotguns. Pete and Wade kept their guns in cases like that.
Mick tied the two saddle horses to the back of the buggy|I'll handle Dekes, and I'll do so through legal means. That's all there is to it."

Bria looked at him, then over at me. I could see the struggle in her blue eyes. Part of her agreed with Donovan that it would be best to handle Dekes through the law. That's what they were supposed to do, that's what the two of them had sworn to do as cops|“Thank you,” says Abram, “I will read it with great interest, knowing that you are a part of the story. And I will be sure to keep it from Raymee. You are right, she knows too much for a young woman.”
“What is this delicious, fatty meat?” asks Danglars, who has by now dug into his plate with enthusiasm.
“I am pleased you like it,” says Abram|Damien held on to her hips and thrust up hard to meet her frantic movements, until they were both sweaty and hot and excited, their cries filling the bedroom, the antique bed slamming against the plaster wall.

She came first, which she expected to do. Damien didn't seem the type to give in until a woman had been satisfied|When I called Patty, I could hear her disappointment that Josh bailed on us and that just makes me feel worse for being so late. In my mind, I picture her sitting alone and despondent drinking her wine.
The street light changes as I reach the corner so I have to wait to cross. I see the little sidewalk balcony of the pub and scan the crowd, searching for Patty|The top rested open at an angle and it overflowed with rolled up manuscripts all standing on end.
“Something wong?” Mermin inquired.
Remembering the note in his trunk at home had instructed not to tell anyone what he had, Andy replied, “Uh, no, just admiring your trunk.”
“That is a special twunk,” replied Mermin|Fareed hadn't seen anything like that in the man's eyes since his late wife.

The gregarious Rose eyed him back with open appreciation and murmured to Gwen for all to hear, "So incredible things do come to those who wait, eh, sweetie?" She didn't wait for Gwen's reaction and turned to Fareed|"By the Wolf?"
"No," the other man said firmly, "not this time. We must be very near to the culmination of this long odyssey."
"So we are to follow this phantom?" Dredger grunted, clearly not convinced.
“No, my friend, this is no phantom|The young candidate looked in the direction indicated by the older man but could see nothing; a small hill was in his way. “Where?” he asked.
Sir Reginod chuckled. “It is a bit larger than the young one,” he said.
Squire Hibbard, shaded his eyes, and looked more closely at the hill|How had they kept from drowning? Then he remembered the life jackets. Boots was not wearing hers when she came in, but she had had it on at the Tankard.

He told his theory to Vikus. "Yes, something of that nature must have occurred. But then they would have been trapped in the Labyrinth," said Vikus|All these years, Julia had been carrying the weight of the world on her now-frail shoulders, blaming herself for Billy the Bootlegger’s death. Ronni empathized with the burden Julia was carrying, After all, somewhere in Topeka her mother was recovering from being drugged by Charles and his crazy mother. If anyone understood the guilt of harm coming to people you love, it was Ronni|He would need his wits to make this assignment sound more difficult than it was.

"Well, if that's the case," Goodness muttered, her shoulders heaving with a deliberate sigh, "I certainly hope she isn't interested in the young man she's with. It's perfectly obvious they aren't the least bit suited|I know they are because I choose to believe they are.
And I choose to believe they are still alive.

But right now I am curled up in the fetal position and I am suffocating.
Come on, Rebecca. Move!
There is only one door to this room. I actually don’t know if it is locked|Ever so carefully, tilting the can gently, she poured the bubbly brown brew into one basket.  She popped open the other can and filled the other basket.
Helen held her basket up in the air and checked the bottom.
"Is it holding?  Look underneath," asked Stephanie, "We don't want our poison running out."
"Yes, it is holding," said Helen|Sharma replied, 'Until tomorrow morning at least, my lady.'
Mecolo responded, 'Then perhaps we will see each other again before you leave?' Sharma nodded and gave her a searching look. Mecolo's eyes glowed before she said, ‘That’s good.’ Then, still keeping up the bright facade, she asked, ‘And how have you been, Sharma|Though Sharon had been friendly enough to him since his return, now that Gabrielle was back in town, Sharon left no doubt as to where her loyalty lay. She'd shown it tonight.

Still, he wasn't about to let anyone dictate whether or not he could see Gabrielle. He and Sharon wanted the same thing-what was best for Gabrielle.

With a determined step, he strode around Sharon and came up behind Gabrielle|"Bree, dear, there's someone I'd like you to meet."

A familiar refrain. She'd heard it a lot in her twenty-nine years, and it rarely led beyond an awkward first date.

Still, she rose to her feet and planted a smile firmly on her lips.

"Gavin, this is my daughter, Bree|You are our most senior claims adjuster by more than ten years, and 75% of the adjusters you work with make more money than you do because they started later in time and at a higher rate of pay to begin with. You have always been so damnably loyal, you never even looked for another job. I doubt you had any idea how much more money you could make elsewhere|You were complaining about the view like two seconds ago."
"It's not that I didn't like the view, it's just that this whole abandoned space station thing is kind of freaking me out."
"It's not abandoned." Seven countered.
"What do you mean it's not abandoned|“ Susan, you are a terrific cook. I don’t know which I enjoyed most. Your home made cherry pie last night or what we’re having now. I guess I have to say that  it’s a toss-up.”
“ Thanks, I love to cook and experiment with recipes. I suppose I can say it’s one  of my hobbies|I guess now you'll have two places in the world where you belong, instead of only one."

Natalie nodded slowly, then turned to her father. Blake moved closer, kneeling in front of Natalie. For once, he didn't look like a three-hundred-fifty-dollar-an-hour lawyer. He looked like a scared, vulnerable man. "I've made some mistakes......" He glanced at Annie and gave her a hesitant smile, then turned back to Natalie|"Of course," the nurse said pleasantly, turning Paul into a room and wheeling him up to the examination table. "Do you think you can stand up, sir?"

Jeanne Louise set Livy in the chair by the door, noting the child was waking. She could only control so many minds at once. Sighing to herself, she murmured soothingly to the girl and then turned and walked over to Paul|Vieve stepped toward him and puffed up her chest. "Message for Mr. Algonquin Shrimpdittle from Professor Lefoux," she said in her high treble voice.

"Give to me, young sir," boomed back the porter from behind his faceless confusion of gears and cogs.

"Can't be done," replied Vieve|She could say it wasn't bad if she wanted, but Carmine couldn't think of a more inhumane scenario.

“You’re right.  Crying isn’t going to help.  I only wish I knew he was okay.  John has never stayed away without letting me know where he was,” she squared her shoulders and took a deep, calming breath.
“You should’ve seen his face last night, Tom|On the fifth day of their journey, Ewan sent Diormid ahead to announce their impending arrival and also to find out if Cameron had already arrived and what the mood was at court.

They paused in their travel and Ewan coaxed Mairin to eat while they awaited Diormid's return.

"I don't want you to worry," he murmured.

She raised her head until her gaze met his and her blue eyes shone with love. "I have faith in you, Ewan|There is a piken close on his heels. I'm afraid for him-he doesn't have anywhere to go-but when Hannu reaches the edge of the ravine he jumps, landing safely on the other side. It's a jump I could never make, and neither can the piken.

He's safe.

Except: My father is waiting for him on the other side of the ravine|He'd heard the Moles as soon as he'd broken into the wooded area. Their laughing voices had echoed from the farming space. He'd crept over and watched them, stunned to see so much food left to rot. He'd planned to leave after a few minutes, but by then he'd gotten curious about the girl. When Soren tore the eyepiece from her face, he couldn't stand by and watch any longer, even if she was just a Mole|Then Matt and Sarah heard the sound of a slap and walked into sight of the pair.  It was Aaron and one of the teenage girls.  It didn’t look good…
“Aaron, what’s going on here?” said Matt looking at him seriously.
“… We’ll just having a little fun,” said Aaron|She wished she could discuss it with Carlos, but didn't feel comfortable talking about cat shifters in front of Tanit.

They'd figured out what the tigers meant about prayers. At the top of the mountain, they'd spotted a big boulder with a symbol painted on it. With a shudder, Tanit had explained it was a prayer for protection.

As they wound downhill, they noticed several other boulders with the same symbol|“But there's no flight to Miami until tomorrow.”
“I'm not going to Miami. I'm going to Georgetown.”
“Why?”
“Cameron Andrews has offered me a job. The least I can do is hear him out.”
“You going into competition with my brother?”
“I don't think we'll be competing|Dr. White went up to the table and revealed something that had been wrapped in red velvet. At first glance it looked like a large clock, the kind you might stand on a mantelpiece. "I've adjusted all the settings. The window of time available to you two is three hours."

At a second glance, I realized it wasn't a clock|None of my friends at the dog park believed me when I told them that my masters had been bringing me to the hospital to have a real doctor check on my puppies.
"The vet, you mean," they said.  "They take you to the vet's office."
But my masters had taken me to the vet before, and the doctor was different|Jill might not be ready to learn her lesson, but someone needed to teach Steve some manners. Nikki was ready to be the one to do it, with or without Jill’s consent.
“Jill, honey,” Nikki said slowly. “I didn’t want to tell you this, but I slipped somethin’ into your drink.”
Jill jerked her head around to look at Nikki|“Have you finished searching their rooms?”
“Yeah,” he said, glancing in Addy’s direction, “and we found some interesting things.”
“We should speak privately.” Juliette started to walk away with Patrick, but looked back over her shoulder. “I’ll meet with you in the morning, Addy|"The crawlers knew you would follow," Ares slipped in, before Gregor lost it.

"Of course, I followed! And man, when I get hold of those bugs, they'd better have some really good explanation for this whole thing. How far are we from their place?" said Gregor.

"Several hours. But I am taking you to Regalia," said Ares|"Dad this is Miracle St. James. She's new at school. Miracle, this is my father, Wayne Bradford."

"It's a pleasure to meet you, sir," Miracle said politely, extending her hand.

Wayne gripped it politely and smiled.

"Nice to meet you, too, Miracle|Laurel looked up from the hot water she was pouring over some dried leaves in a mug. The end of her nose was pink. "Maybe it was one of us," she said.

"Like who?" Deborah blazed back.

"Like somebody who didn't want her in the Club. Somebody who was afraid she'd come in on the wrong side," said Laurel|Well, it was like that. Something had grabbed my cane, and I was being pulled along with it whether I wanted to be or not. I don’t know how. I don’t know why. But I got pulled along with it, and we went through.”
I heard him stand and walk around the desk again, and a few seconds later, he tugged gently on the cane|The fourth gear change was flawless.
“Well done,” Chris said. “That’s essentially all driving is. You’ve got a nice touch with cars. Nice to know you got something from me.”
Maisie couldn’t help but smile.
“Really?” she said. “You think I’m good at driving|'Curtain goes up again in two minutes,' said Salzella. 'I'd better go and round up the orchestra. They'll all be in the Stab In The Back over the road. The swine can get through half a pint before the applause has died away.'

'Are they capable of playing?'

'They never have been, so I don't see why they should start now,' said Salzella|His voice was even less friendly than it had been the last time.

"I have every right to sit here should I choose to do so," she returned formally. She held out her bag of popcorn. "Here," she said.

He frowned. "I beg your pardon?"

"I'm offering you some of my popcorn|Believe me, I wouldn’t wait for you to find him. I’d strangle him with my own hands.”
“So there’s not even one person you suspect?”
“Patricia didn’t talk much about herself. You know how psychiatrists are. She’s the one who asked the questions. As far as I’m concerned, it must have been one of her patients|He hadn't realized just how stuffy it had been in the library until they were on the street.
"Did it reap too much information or too little?" Teria asked.
"Both," said Gaent. He hesitated. "Did you get good notes?"
"That man talks awfully fast."
Gaent agreed. "I think we're looking for someone who could do these things, Teria|“The sales lady looked at it and said, ‘It says here it’s a bracelet with a charm.  You have only a bracelet.  I can’t give a refund.’
“I was completely embarrassed.  I looked Pat right in the eyes and glared.  I could only imagine what her scheme was.
“Pat said, ‘If you won’t do it, I want to see the manager|But, if you are working in kilos, you should think in terms of around 5000 kilos.’
‘That big? And how fast is he likely to be able to move? I’m trying to judge kinetic energy here.’
‘He can probably achieve above the equivalent of 60 kilometres per one hour for short periods.’
‘Great! I’m not going to get in his way then|'Your BFG is right,' the Queen said to Sophie. 'Those nine man-eating brutes did go to Sweden.'

'It's horrible,' Sophie said. 'Please stop them, Your Majesty.'

'I'd like to make one more check before I call out the troops,' the Queen said. Once more, she looked up at the BFG|A stampede could occur, and because I’m small, I think I could easily get crushed.
But when Kino started talking about rocks and pebbles, the act flowed through naturally.  It was easy to make the crowd believe that he really has power.  The last part was indeed beautiful, when he threw the rock upward.  I almost didn’t catch it because we didn’t rehearse, but at the last minute, I realized what he wanted to happen and I dove down, to catch the rock|And there isn't a government ship available in this entire half of the Sector. By the time we organize a pursuit they'll be out of the Galaxy and halfway to the Magellanic Clouds. Captain, it was your responsibility to maintain an adequate guard.'

The captain cried, 'It was our first day out of space. Who could have known -'

Zammo interrupted fiercely, 'Wait a while, captain|Funny how things changed in the blink of an eye.

The elevator opened to the parking garage below, and I rushed toward my car. Just as I opened the door, someone call ed out my name, "Christian Davison?" It was posed as a question.

I paused to look over my shoulder at the man in a basebal cap and jacket approaching from across the garage|He'd met Larry in the library one day. They'd had a lot in common-liked the same books and music. Larry was gentle and quiet, and he knew how to make Oliver feel like somebody. But in the end he'd turned out to be a big disappointment. Sometimes Oliver regretted what he'd had to do to Larry|Will those of us working closely on marketing for the hotel get a chance to see it in person?" I was dying to go to Dubai and I knew I had a look of quiet desperation on my face.

My question distracted Sebastian and he gave me a half-hearted smile. "We are going to have a grand opening and all senior management will be invited. We do that with all of our hotels|"What do you say we see how the ring fits?" His eyes search my face and I smile, looking at his hand. He leans forward and places a light kiss on my lips before taking his right hand away from my face, pulling the ring off his finger, and pulling my hand towards him. I feel the cool metal slide along my finger and over my knuckle|The yarn she had been gathering into a ball from the same strands spread in a loop between Judith’s arms, dropped to the floor. She even quit the drawing room, leaving Judith to stare at the empty seat, a blush descending hotly on her cheeks.
She felt tears spring to her eyes and might have given way to such powerful feelings had Kelthorne not come to her in that moment and picked up the yarn|When her mom and the officer turned back to where he had been standing, he was gone.  
Carol collapsed into a chair.  “Oh, Mathew, we missed him.  We missed him.  And he probably took the Requiem back with him.”  She began to weep uncontrollably.  
“Don’t cry---please,” said Mathew|Georgianna looked up just in time to see Lacie pout in frustration as she turned her attention back to her own tiles, moving them one at a time from one hand to the other.
“Well, I only have two to go,” Lacie quipped.
Jacob looked at her, a competitive glint in his eye, and chuckled.
“I never liked snow,” Lacie admitted, flicking through the rest of her tiles|But Matt saw the look in his friend’s eyes in the pictures, from his own hotel room in Canada. He noticed that Paul always seemed to be staring at Selena in the pictures. He called Selena more and more often, never mentioning his unfounded fears to her. He was finishing up filming in Toronto, but he didn’t know yet exactly when he would be free and he hadn’t mentioned it to Selena|"Now we're in the Capitol Rotunda and they seem to be looking around, taking their time. Wait, they're walking towards the House Chamber. I don't think the guards who are lining up right now will be able to stop them. Let's move behind this column in case there's trouble. We're live right? Okay."
The aliens walked towards the entrance to the Chamber|"With a man like Julian at your side?"

"You have a man like Andre at your side," Camille reminded her. "It's not stopping you." Camille, Tasha was sure, hadn't meant that to bite as much as it did.

"It's different with me and Andre than it was for you and Julian|Both brothers shifted self-consciously, embarrassed, but obviously thankful for the compliment in front of their peers.
“What’s the land like?” asked Rod.
“Dead flat at both sites and three hundred metres apart,” answered Bill.
One house was a level and a half, the other a full two level.
“You know with a few adjustments you could save lots on your plumbing,” offered Rod|"They do believe we need this net, but not just us. Anywhere there are people who are part of the tribe or even allies of it sleeping in the jungle, the tribe believes you should hand weave a net and suspend it amongst the trees above your heads. They taught us the weaving pattern and which vines and plants we were to us to make the net|Something I didn’t recognise. It was male.
“Why would I start writing in a man’s voice?” I said out loud to myself.
“Because you’ve been hacked.” Came the response.
I sat upright, on the bed.
“What?!”
“You’ve gone and left some very old and vulnerable chips in your head, and now you’ve been hacked|A better plan was to get Gabriel in my hot little hands-well, my cold little hands-and then call Dorrie. I'd say, "See? It turned out okay." And then I'd call Tegan and let Gabriel oink into the phone or something.

Or, no. I'd call Tegan first, to spread the joy, and then I'd call Dorrie|And now it’s your drink.”
Carolyn moved her head from side to side. “I don’t think I want to have my own drink. Although it is nice to be able to order something my friends back home never drink.” Back home. Wish I hadn’t said that.
“No, you don’t have to have your own drink|She laughed in spite of herself. "You're so sick."

He smiled with pride-gods, how she'd missed that shit-eating grin of his.

"What about the rest of the family? Are they returning?"

That sobered him immediately. "They're still in Oregon. When the cubs are born, they'll return|His feet were dangling. Their fingers were intertwined in the kind of grip that was about to slip away. He'd fall if she let go. He was handsome, with angular features, brown hair fluttering and obscuring his face. His eyes were looking down at the pit below. At first glance it looked like she was pulling him up, away from the pit|Zip and I."
"Thanks. I don't know what I would have done without your support."
"It's not a problem really. I do what I can."
"You're acting like it's not a big deal but it is. No one has been here for me like you and Zip|But he knows me so well, he said, “Kari, I have a hunch you’re here to pick my brane.”
That’s eksactly right and I told him so.
Then I started. “My friend tell me about she have bebe but NOY take it away. She say no more bebes for her, ever. Tell me all about how it work.”
“You want a bebe, don’t you, Kari|“You have to learn to adapt, living the way we do,” Majorette was looking around at the destruction littered across the tracks. “Now,” she began, slinging her carbine over her shoulder. Rachael took this as a cue and lowered the gun from Fluky's head. “What are we going to do about this?” 
“Do?” I parroted.
“Yes, to get you boys back on the tracks|And how do the first people find out where it's being held?" Hunter shrugged. "Door?" he asked.

"I've never thought about it." They turned a corner. Door held up her lamp. "Not bad at all," said Door.

"And fast, too," said Hunter|Langdon took it and switched it on, shining the beam on the back of the key.

The back luminesced instantly. There was writing there. In penmanship that was hurried but legible.

"Well," Langdon said, smiling. "I guess we know what the alcohol smell was."

Sophie stared in amazement at the purple writing on the back of the key|Now the only thing missing from his perfect life with Alisha was the joy of children.
Jim recently won a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.  It was your typical David and Goliath case with the injured and suffering individual fighting against the uncaring corporation.  The media loved it and because of his talents, the jury forced them to pay and pay big.
Jim was out of town sewing up some last minute details, when he decided to call home and check on Alisha|He'd heard the same stomping rhythm before as she left a particularly frustrating board meeting. Now was not the time to ponder the reason he knew her well enough to read the mood of her footsteps.

Stopping beside Nancy, Carlos reined in his own frustration over the woman's surprise arrival.

Nancy's smile widened. "What perfect timing. I'm so glad I caught you before you left, Carlos|My name is Ivy. I’m here to tutor someone named Zachary,” I tell her.
“Hm. Master is inside,” she says politely, letting me in. “I will go get him. You are welcome to wait in the study.”
She leads me into the study, then goes out again to look for Zachary|His brows rose in surprise when he saw me.
“Hey,” he said. “What’s up?”
I straightened up. “Taking some pictures.”
Mark looked out over the lake. “Get any good ones?”
“Probably not,” I said pessimistically. 
He held his hand out, and I gave him my camera|When they reached number ten, Diane unlocked the door and they stepped inside.

The small room looked and smelled as though it had been unoccupied for a long time. There were twin beds with rumpled bedcovers and two worn chairs next to a scarred desk.

Kelly looked around. "It may be small, but it sure is ugly. I'll bet it's never been cleaned|The events at school last summer had scarred Sacha, the first time he had felt that his life was not fully in his own control.  Being ‘led astray’ was probably what most people thought had happened to him.  Peter had said as much even though he had shouted at him for being ‘beastly’ on their return to Hong Kong.
“You are just too naïve to be let out of the house, Sacha|It occurred to him then that he was probably being foolish debating the point at all. It seemed unlikely that the Wolf would let him stray, when it had already made quite certain that Tom got this far.
But was this actually true, he asked himself? Hadn't he come close to death several times in the course of his journey, and all because of the Wolf|I hid behind the curtain in my bedroom. He just stood there smoking, like some buffoon, staring at the house. And then he walked past my house, up towards the cul-de-sac. He got into his truck. It was parked right in front of Trudy Markus’s house. I think it was her, standing next to the truck|"I got it all right, loud and clear. You want to end our marriage and-"

"Mom," Lori said, cutting off her father. "Do you still love Dad?"

"Of course I do. That's a ridiculous question."

"Will you still love me if we're divorced|He probably hadn't been dreaming about being squeezed dry by Mr. Bishop.

"It's Claire," she said. "I'm sorry to call so early--"

"Is it early? Oh. Been up all night, just fell asleep." He yawned. "Glad you're all right, Claire|He cradled her in his arms while trying not to move her too much for fear she had internal injuries as before.  Within minutes the paramedics arrived accompanied by the same two police officers that arrived last time.  They immediately loaded her onto a gurney and rushed her to the hospital.
“The same as before, beaten up by your father?” asked an officer.
Jay just shook his head as he gathered his car keys to follow the ambulance|A woman who could love the darkest of the angels.

Gone.

Sam stood behind the line of blazing fire. "You're out of control. You need to-"

Az aimed the gun at him. "I told you to summon the witch." Angels couldn't help him. Rule followers. But the witch ... Mateo followed no one's rules|The three congratulated him and he helped them finish the bottle. They were full of questions.
“How old is she?”
“Who is she?”
“Are you going to be rich?”
Hadrian sighed. “The lady is Lilan Walsh, and I know she is somewhat younger than me. And no, I don’t think I will ever be rich|"I painted that for Kayleigh."

I don't even dare to breathe. I'm afraid anything-movement, a sound-will silence Harley's confession.

"It's been three years. I was a little older than Elder is now. Kayleigh and I ... we matched. We couldn't have been more different, but we matched|She was practically salivating. I pulled Kyle over to the side.

"Tame your dog Kyle; she is embarrassing you."

He glared at me, "Angela, let's go."

I looked over at Connor who was steadily smiling at me.

"What?"

"Nothing, you are just..."

"Just what Connor|“Quite the little arsenal you have these days,” Freddy noted.
“Pays to be prepared,” Milk said.
“Not so prepared were you though? Not prepared for ol’ Freddy,” he mused.
“It would seem not,” noted Hendricks. 
“No, who is?” asked Freddy rhetorically. 
“I hear the Grim Reaper is waiting,” said Milk|His body went limp and he passed out, stuck half to death with needles.
Haven turned around and saw Bastian walking toward her with his hands up. “Let me explain,” he said.
“You lied to me,” said Haven. Blue light flashed across her vision.
“I know I did,” said Bastian|asked Alicia briskly.
"Get a map of Hoy and pick a place to start from and we walk to the middle of nowhere from there," suggested Frank. 
Alicia reached for a map from the top drawer of the filing cabinet, opened it up and spread it out.
"How about taking the Landrover to the end of the Rackwick road and turning left along this track," said Alicia|Eddie plinked the rim of his mug.  He would feel a lot better knowing someone was coming back.  “Another coffee.”
“Sure thing,” she said, winking at him.  With a quick turn, she bounded back into the crowd towards the bar.
“Got the ladies looking out for you, huh, Eddie|Lord Odin took her to a cabin below and offered her a chair across from him.  "Now, what have you found out about Mellen?"
	"Not much, just that he was here and still has a headache.  Did you know the Commandant assigned me the same mission to go after him?" 
	"What did he say to you when he gave you the mission|Even that woman wouldn’t stoop so low. She may have bad taste, but she isn’t a thief. She bought it from my estate. You know. When I died.”
“Your estate? When you died?”
"Yeah, you know. When I died and became an oogey boogey ghost|I mean ... it would be ridiculous to think ..." The words trailed off as Adrian pondered the idea.

The last words had sparked fresh anger in Francis's veins. He clenched his hand around his glass as he glared across at Adrian. "Ridiculous? Just what exactly is so ridiculous about it? Isn't she good enough for you, Adrian|He paid the driver, and we got out. The music was even louder. I could feel the beat of the drums vibrating beneath my feet through my shoes. I grabbed his hand and went to the music.
I had never seen a live band that wasn’t an orchestra. Some people just watched, but a lot of them were dancing|A shiver ran down her spine as she read the spell a second time. All Hallow's Eve. Among witches and warlocks, it was considered the most magical night of the year, a night of power, when the veil that separated this world from the world of spirits was at its thinnest.

She read the poem again. It seemed much too easy and yet, if it was remotely possible, All Hallow's Eve was the perfect night for such a spell|He curled his arm, lifting her and bringing her straight to his chest so that he could catch her in his arms and swing her up. In one graceful move, he rose to his feet, then twirled her around.

"Airplane, airplane, airplane," she started chanting while Jess turned faster.

Her mother gaped at them. "You're going to be wearing those chocolate chips soon if you don't stop, Jess|Peter reflected on Rachael’s earlier comments, “Were you near the two soldiers?”
Morales stammered before answering, “Ah, they kept us apart.  I wasn’t near them.”
“Okay, you’re a lucky man.”
Peter said goodbye to everyone in the office and left for the airport in a taxi.
En route, he dialed Rachael’s mobile phone, which went directly to voicemail, “Hi, Rachael, it’s Peter|Don’t make me sing the song.” Maxx shakes his head and begins to whistle the same theme he was whistling earlier.
“Maxx, what are you singing?” Sean asks the question I was about to ask.
“Yes, Maxx. What are you singing?” Madeline drops her fork, wipes her mouth with a napkin, then turns to stare at Maxx|How could the guy have disappeared so fast? 
Angus and Vanora followed close behind Fane, sprinting down a rutted path where a black horse and buggy waited. He motioned at the kids. “Get in, we must hurry.” 
They rushed to the carriage. Angus climbed aboard beside Fane and reached down to help Vanora|It was only expected of a Princess to search for her father emperor.  
“Take no worry about it,” I said and started galloping away from him.

The road to Nivaton took longer for me than usual.  Maybe it was due to my bulging stomach.  Riding a horse had become a challenging activity for me.  I felt the baby kicking, probably annoyed at being pressed against the saddle|You’re the strongest wolf any of us has ever seen. You took on three full-grown wolves by yourself on the night of your initiation.” Her brown eyes gaze into mine. “You could save us all.”



-42-
Our families form one of the oldest packs in Montana, Kayla tells me. They emigrated from Europe in the early 1800s, coming to America to escape the eradication of wolves|Glass shattered, and I heard a muffled ugghh as the guy went down like a sack of potatoes beneath an avalanche of hardback books. He did not get up. Out cold, I presumed.
Behind me, Gil’s footsteps had stopped, as had the waving of the light. I knelt in the darkness over the man, pulling him free of the books|She pointed behind the boy.
Chad turned and saw the cupcake as Preacher and Kat broke out in song.
“It’s your birthday!” they sang off tune.  “It’s your birthday!  It’s a special day.  It’s a special day.”  They shouted loudly, “Happy birthday Chad|But it was too late for that when he made the announcement.   
So she let him go. There were no obvious tears as she told him it was over; that she wasn’t going to follow him around the world, from one base to another. She wanted her own career, her own life.
And, for 3 years, they were apart|In the theater lobby, she once again purchased a small bag of popcorn and a cold soda, then walked into the dimly lit theater.

She saw that Mark was already in one of the wheelchair spaces. Tessa had been right; this was the perfect movie.

Without hesitation, Barbie moved around the back and entered the row from the opposite direction. She sat down, leaving one empty seat between her and Mark|At least it hadn't seemed so to him but it looked like he was wrong. Simon began reading him the riot act as soon as they sat down to dinner that evening.
"They're good men," his father said to him. "They're the ones you'll need in your corner when you take over the Gazette."
"I don't need them in my corner," he said, "because I'm never going to take over the Gazette|"You're unbelievable."

"And you came with Christian Prescott," he says. "Your dream come true."

At the moment it seems like more of a nightmare. I cast a look at Christian and Kay over my shoulder. Predictably, Kay is crying. She's clinging to Christian's shoulders and sobbing|It seemed pretty obvious he didn't meet muster. The woman's mouth turned down with displeasure as she took in his attire and the state of his hair.

"You need a haircut," she announced, and then turned to include DJ in her displeasure. "Both of you do, and a shave|He curled in a tiny, kitty circle and started purring.

Cash didn't say a word at the addition of Zee he just kept clicking through documents.

Abby watched them fly by as she stroked her cat and Cash twirled a lock of her hair between his fingers.

Then, before she knew it, she was asleep|Baking Christmas cookies with Mom and Grandma the year before she went to the nursing home. Cross-country meets. Marathon training.

I feel something. I feel something. Warmth in my stomach. And I hear... the hum of electricity. I realize I hear it because it is coming from the tubes down my throat.

My body slips. Just a fraction of a millimeter, but it slips|The moment that deed is done, I'll let you know," Fen assured the farmer.

The wind came in from the north, blowing with it a heavy fog. Gregori strode out of the dense mist, his shoulders wide, his silver eyes blazing. His sharp glance went from the farmer to the blackened ground and then to Fen|Nadia remembered the magical barrier at the edge of town. She looked again at the battered, depressed town that surrounded her.

From the crash, she'd known something powerful was in this town. But what if that powerful force was ... draining Captive's Sound? Dragging it down?

In her mind flashed the image of the ground caving in beneath Verlaine's car, and she shuddered|Selena opened her eyes hours later and, as the room swam into focus, she saw first her mother in a chair beside her, and then she saw from the corner of her eye, her father, Beth and Matt sitting in chairs along the wall. “Matt?” Her voice was low and hoarse, yet the surprise was still evident. Her mother stepped out of the way and nodded her head at Matt|He pulled me up tightly against him and whispered in my ear, "Watch out for that one," then dropped his arm and nodded one last time at Preston before walking outside our room and closing the curtain behind him.

I turned back to Preston. "She's going to be okay." This time I smiled in relief and walked over to wrap my arms around Preston|"Fascinating," Jack said, but it was clear from the sound of his voice that the fascination wouldn't last much longer than the cigarette had.

"So it wasn't you?" I asked.

"No," he said, still looking at the photo.

"Maybe it was Ariel?"

Say her name.

Now Jack looked up, a little bit tired of me.

"Ev, you know it couldn't have been Ariel|"If I didn't, I should be careful who I said it to," he said. "Very, very careful. Or I should soon feel the headsman's blade go through my neck."

Ben stared at Peyna silently.

"You say you are his friend, and I believe you." Peyna sat up straighter in his chair and leveled a finger at Ben|I turned to Kel with a questioning glance. "Do you want to have the discussion I deferred now or later? Are you on a schedule?"

"Don't worry about it. I've withstood many punishments over the years."

Guilt flared in a hard, awful twinge. "I don't want to be the reason you get hurt, Kel|"I love you, Jack," she whispered, forcing tears into her eyes. She was trying for an Oscar performance, but her words didn't have even the simple warmth that Emma's did at just saying his name.

Jack stared her down, his hazel eyes hard and cold. He was going to make him late getting back to Emma|She looked away, but not before he noticed that the glimmer behind her eyes had dulled. Only a hopeless sadness remained.

"So?" He heard a voice ask. It was Claire. "What's the big secret?"

"What big secret?" Francis asked with a grin.

Claire rolled her eyes as she sighed with exasperation. "Do I need to tickle you again, Francis|"Maybe, but it still managed zero to sixty in 5.7 seconds. Not to mention, it is gorgeous."

"And if you were to get one of those what color would it be?"

She didn't hesitate to answer. "Red, of course. It shouldn't be in any other color|He reaches down and picks up a rock about the size of a soda can.  Kain’s hand is so massive that only a small portion of the rock can be seen through his grip.  He starts to squeeze the rock.

I grinned.

"Why don't you just go in a boat, like normal people?" he asked, pressing buttons on his phone.

"Right, and you don't consider windsurfing to be sailing|"I'm not her, Zach."

"I know, darlin'. And I'm sorry for holding you accountable. I'm the one at fault for not seeing it sooner." He shook his head. "The same as I am for not recognizing what she was doing."

"You can't blame yourself for what happened, Zach|"Did we? I'd forgotten already."

Simon hadn't noticed Blair had left the room until the enforcer returned, holding up half a cookie and scowling at Meg.

"What did you give Skippy?" Blair demanded.

"I wanted him to calm down, so I gave him a chamomile cookie," Meg said, narrowing her eyes at Blair|But she knew what to say now.

"And what makes you think the Council is going to be around after the millennium?" She shook her head.

Morgead blinked once, lizardlike. "He's planning on getting rid of the Council|"Maybe so, Colby, but then again you're the one who trusted Daniels enough to take the loan," Paul snapped at her.

Colby winced as though he'd struck her. To her shock, her eyes actually brimmed with tears. Ginny ran to her, circling her waist with protective arms, glaring openly at her brother.

"Do not let me hear you speak to your sister again like that, Paul|"Unfortunately it will be some weeks before she'll be able to return to her own home."

"Weeks?" Anne Marie repeated. This was a shock and she knew Ellen would be terribly disappointed.

"I'm sorry."

"How...many weeks?" Anne Marie asked, wondering how she'd explain this to Ellen|"Yes, that would be odd," said Gaent. "We might want to find out who else has knowledge of the type of ocule manipulations that Professor Torret is doing."
"Outside of the college?"
"Outside or within different disciplines," said Gaent. "Maybe I should find out if Professor Torret has a counterpart in Denaphaos," said Gaent|Then he said some things about you that weren't very complimentary.

"But he admitted I'm an adult and that I need to live my own life. He said it was clear to him that you'd changed-even since he'd seen you last. I think you surprised him. And he isn't used to being surprised|In the quiet aftermath of his shouting the woman finally relented and followed Carter to the door. 
James tried to leave the confines of the register, desperate to escape the prying eyes raking over him. His jumper caught on a hook stuck to the side of the counter. With fumbling hands he pulled at the clothing now tightly held by the hook|I pose a lot of “what ifs,” and talk about the novel I’m writing to give a premise for my odd questions. 
“Would you have liked a younger sibling?” I ask Zephyr. It is not the first time I ask him this; it frequently arises as he is growing up and after he is an adult, so the question does not seem odd to him. He is mostly surrounded by people who have siblings|Like a vision from a dream, Abby was leaning over him, her face smeared with muck and her hair hanging in limp tangles, but her expression was one of gentle concern. Dante took a moment to savor the enchanting view before reluctantly pushing himself up to his elbows. Turning his head, he regarded the twitching demon before returning his attention to Abby|His smile was dazzlingly white within the framework of skin as smooth and rich as the finest milk chocolate. There was a smattering of tight gray curls at Raguel's temples, but that telltale sign of aging was an affectation to disguise his immortality. Unlike Adrian, the archangel embraced the media attention that came his way.

Raguel withdrew a cigar from his pocket and offered it to Adrian|‘Tis that she or I. I do not know her, but she claims that she has been wronged.”
The tawny she-wolf let out a thin wail like a crying pup, and curled into a quivering knot on the damp ground. Alanki shifted with some discomfort, aware of how insensitive she had sounded, although she had been being truthful.
Misari looked at the she-wolf and then looked at Alanki|As mountains of gold and jewels appeared, Andrew, unaware he had even spoken the words said, “Oh no.”
Both of them knew the answer couldn’t be taken back even if Connor had wanted to.

Hmm.

Jaeden padded away from her mother and wandered into the kitchen. A magik was standing on the porch, but he was a few meters from the kitchen doors.

She was fast. Perhaps not as fast as Caia and Lucien, but fast enough to get past the magik|Vinnie, the same.”
We all stood up and walked to the front door. Phillip left and Manny took his tuxedo jacket from the coat tree. “Doc, I’ll be in touch about some of your lists, but you should be rid of me soon.”

Arriving in the ancient Memphis, he was hailed as a divinely sent liberator. After several days of feasting and celebrating in Memphis, a priest of Ammon asked to speak with Alexander. He arrived with an interpreter who was a Greek trader. "What is it that you want, Holy One," said Alexander|He didn’t know who you were looking for.  He just said you’d been searching for years.”  
Roquefort didn’t answer right away.  Finally, he said somberly: “Yeah, I been looking for my dad.”
“Your dad?  What was your dad doing down here?”  
What was almost as surprising was the idea that a wild guy like Roke ever had a dad|Over time, that resentment turned nasty...made him bitter." Gabriel sighed. "I think the final straw for Malcolm was when it became clear that I would never charge our brethren for my assistance."

Gabriel looked out the windows, over the fields. "I had money, whoever joined with me, contributed to the wealth of the family, but that wasn't enough for Malcolm|“Baatmaan…you got ta hep me…this old low life done throwed me outta my place and I can’t get my stuff and I ain’t got nowhere to go…. what you gonna do Baatmaan?”
Besides being slightly taken aback about being caught in his underwear, Joseph was totally unprepared. This guy was actually talking to him as if Joseph actually were Batman. Never mind the bizarre setting, this guy really thought he was talking to Batman|Because some of them wouldn't be able to hear the command over the crowd noise, we'd told them before the show that they would turn to the right.

During the show we took turns. One of us directed the band from the podium while the other directed down on the field. I was on the field now, and Drew was on the podium|He had been kept waiting for about twenty minutes in a deliberate ploy to undermine whatever confidence he had left.
‘Well, Mr Banks, we meet again’ said Jenkins breezily.
‘I told you everything I know yesterday.  Why am I here again?’ asked Banks in a display of bravado.
‘Just one or two things that have surfaced,’ said Jenkins|Just long enough until I get my own place."

Peter placed a finger over her lips. "I don't want to hear another word. You can stay for as long as you like."

Laura collapsed and placed her head on his chest. His arms surrounded her.

She sat up. "I don't want, what I mean is, you don't expect..."

"I don't want anything from you, Laura|Be patient." That was Logan. Calm, sure, not at all upset by Drake's pain. Then again, he was the closest thing they had to a real doctor and if pain freaked him out, he was in the wrong line of work.

Logan had a hand on Helen's shoulder, keeping her from reaching out to Drake|I should have known there was more to it than met the eye, especially after the Apate jewels had been stolen from the library. But the eerie thing was that all the gems she wore, rubies and emeralds alike, seemed to be glowing-glowing with Reaper-red fire.

I thought of the ID card I'd found in the library, the one I still had in my jeans pocket that talked about the jewels|Joseph sat at his desk, rubbing his temples. His eyes were sunken, his shoulders slumped.

He looked up at Madoc. "What's the emergency?"

Madoc looked at Drake. "Didn't you tell him?"

"He just got back from delivering Chris to the Slayers. We thought we'd give him a minute," said Drake|The speaker continued at that point, going over the race course and the rules. These were all things that Robbie and I had gone over before and were, for the most part, fairly standard. I had followed this race every year, and because of that, I knew the course like the back of my hand. I felt like I could sail the entire thing blindfolded|They…”
The cataphract cut him off, saying something else.
“He says that he agrees with you on all those things,” the translator explained. “He says ‘Your people are dogs. But I still do not understand why you have come. You are one of those people; one of those dogs|“After math, we get a thirty-minute recess, but we have to gather and do aerobic exercise before we can play or eat snack. Then, it’s Russian language class, and after that the science class. You’ll love it,” said Sofia. Her eyes enlarged for a second.
Ivan thought it was funny that Sofia took it upon herself to inform him of the schedule|She stomps quickly up the steps past me and walks straight into the house.  I should have mentioned to her why I was stalling, but it’s too late.  I follow her inside.
“I’m sorry,” Emi says, abruptly stopping as she meets our housekeeper in the foyer.
“Elsa,” I say, walking past them both toward the kitchen, “this is my friend, Emi|"So our whole marriage, everything we've been through, all the battles we've fought against the Reapers ... it was all a lie?" Linus asked.

She leaned down and stared into his eyes. "Every single second of it."

Linus's face was cold and calm, but rage and hurt flashed in his gaze.

She laughed at his fury. "I can't tell you how many times I've longed to see that look on your face, Linus|You real y mustn't take it so hard just because I've had an awful dream.'

'That ... that ... that isn't the reason, ma'am.' The maid's voice was quivering terribly.

'Then for heaven's sake what is the reason?'

'I'm very sorry about the tray, ma'am.'

'Oh, don't worry about the tray|Instinctually, they quickly ducked down as if shielding themselves from a swarm of bees. 
“Over here. Behind the tower opposite the entrance,” the voice urgently whispered. 
Declan and Dalya looked at each other with puzzled expressions, then stepped out of the tower and followed the voice. An elderly woman sat quietly on a green wooden bench just around a bend leading away from the tower|“Kaya, what would happen if a Wanderer forgot to take water into the desert when she left the village?”
Kaya thought about that as the comb stroked through her long hair. “I think she would be sorry that she didn’t have any water.”
“Very good my little love, but consequences don’t care if you’re sorry|Thank you for coming to us this way. I know it is hard for you, for it is plain that you loved him as we did. It ... it is good to know that he had a friend as constant as you. It will be a comfort to us later."

I picked myself up and staggered out and left them to their grief|"However," continues Higgins, nudging, once again, my ankles back together and pulling the hem of my buckskin skirt back down over my knees, over which knees it had crawled up a bit, "you really should stay out of the sun as it is not good for your complexion. I assume you'll be taking your lunch up here on the hatch?"

I nod and smile up at my good friend and protector. "You spoil me too much, Higgins|The ringing stopped as they collapsed onto the mattress together, Gavin's arms firmly around her waist. Bree wriggled against him, enjoying the tantalizing closeness of his hard body.

Then the phone started to ring again.

Gavin groaned. "How can I answer the phone in this condition?"

"But if you don't answer it, you may never get out of this condition|"I've got a better idea," I say. 




33.

"Are you sure about this, Juno?" Altair asks. "It'd be much safer–and easier–just to–"
"No," I counter, arms crossed. "I've made my mind clear on this, Altair|I’ll go see him today, but then I’ll start looking at the employment ads and find another job as a journalist.
She rang the doorbell with a trembling finger.
A hoarse male voice asked, “Who is it?”
She leaned forward and said, “My name is Anya Horvat. I’m a journalist and I would like to speak to you.”
“I don’t want anything to do with journalists|In other words, to send a gram - or, say, an ounce - of anything back in time, you have to disintegrate an ounce of matter completely, to furnish the energy required.'

'Hm-m-m,' I said, 'that's to create the ounce of matter in the past. But aren't you destroying an ounce of matter by removing it from the present|“They used to store fireworks here,” he explained, “but now we can smoke, I don’t have any fireworks,” he laughed. “You want one?” He said, offering me his pack of cigarettes. 
“Oh, they’re the cookie-flavored ones,” I observed. 
“Absolutely. Everyone’s smoking those now, my friend. You can skip food and drink, you can be a bankrupt, but you have to have money for the cookie-flavored cigarettes|Judging is human.'

'We prefer to leave it ultimately to Om,' said Oats and, out here in the dark, that statement sounded lost and all alone.

'Bein' human means judgin' all the time,' said the voice behind him. 'This and that, good and bad, making choices every day... that's human|'Yes, my boy,' said Mario, stepping forward. 'We have all been guiding you, for years, teaching you all the skills you'd need to join our ranks.'

Ezio's head filled with questions. He did not know where to begin. 'I must ask you for news of my family,' he said to Mario|wedding's booked for six o'clock tonight, so we'll have plenty of time to get ready."

"Tonight?" Panic flashed over Bree. For some reason she assumed they'd have at least a day to...to what? If they were getting married, might as well get on with it.

Still, she'd barely had a chance to get used to having a "fiance" yet, and they were going to run down the aisle tonight|It’s a risk,” said Charlie. “But, I say let’s do it.”  
Charlie stuck his hand in the middle of the circle. One by one, the rest of the Rangers put our hands on top. We were all in.
“Rangers, on three,” said Charlie|“Kevin, he sent me that email, remember? I think he would be pretty insane to be the one to do that; it would look too obvious. But I’m not sure who it was. I told you, I was in and out; it could have been Gabe for all I know. Well actually, I know it wasn’t Gabe|He was gorgeous in the shadows. “You don’t understand, Candice.”
“I’m sure I do. I can if you’ll let me.”
He walked closer to me. “I wanted to kiss you a lot more than what we did. I don’t want to take advantage of you in any way, Candice|I hug her back, comforting her, knowing I’m asking her the ultimate decision that would change the course of her life.
Ivy doesn’t say anything more, but continues to cry into my shoulder. I hug her close and kiss her wet hair for some time until she calms down. Then I whisper into her hair, “I love you, Ivy|“You’re too rough. You’re hurting me!”
“Quiet! Now you’re at my place and you’ll do what I want.”
She tried to cover her nakedness with her hands.
“That’s the way, yeah. Good.” He picked up the digital camera he had on the table and pushed the shutter|My pregnancy ain't your business, Rusty."

I tried to grab her arms as I replied. "Will you just calm down and hear me out? I did this so we can be together. Don't you see that this solves everything?"

"What are you talking about? I never said I wanted to be with you, Rusty|"What about her?" She and Miranda had been friends for years. Miranda was a widow, too; she'd been married to an artist, which was one reason she understood Shirley's artistic temperament. Shirley had fun with Miranda and appreciated her encouragement, her loyalty and support. Miranda could be opinionated and headstrong, but that didn't bother Shirley|“Your transport,” said Jia, sweeping her arm towards the horse and carriage. “Climb aboard and we'll be on our way.”
“Wow!” exclaimed Matilda with a smile as she stepped up into the carriage. “This is different.”
“All part of the service,” laughed Jia|The agony went for what felt like days until I reached a tipping point. It was a point when I'd gotten used to the pain and I was about to surrender to death, then I heard Sofia from the other side of the door. She was humming... the sweet, gentle tone of her voice hummed our song. It was exactly what I needed to remind myself that I couldn't die|“We run. If you see the bag, pick it up. Get the EMP grenade ready.”
“Purge will commence in twenty seconds.”
Ben had moved over to the hatch of the tank. It was go time.
I was hesitant. “Wait. What if I don’t find the bag|I’ll need a copy of your driver’s license please.
“Is a copy really necessary?” She tapped her wallet in her hand, a nervous reaction to what her gut instinct was telling her.
“We need to confirm the application information, so yes, ma’am.”
“Come on, Aunt Dia, give him the license|"Can I watch you work?" he asked, motioning into the workshop. He wouldn't go in there without being invited, but surely he could ask to be invited.
"[Not a clue what you're talking about there, buddy.]"
Keeble shrugged once more, then pointed to his eyes, then to the other dwarf, and into the workshop|He called the Valefar, and they appeared. They took the prophecy on his command. My doubt suddenly curdled into betrayal. "You didn't... " My eyes went wide, as anger filled me. I knew he could feel it, but I didn't care. "Tell me you didn't tell them to come here and take the prophecy|An aircar flying low and fast from the west, arcing down to come in for a landing in the valley below.

"That's it," Kresh said. "I'll bet whatever you want that is Fredda Leving, trying to get to him first. Come on. We've got to get therefast before she can get him out of there."

The four of them turned and hurried back to the aircar|O death where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?” 
His dry throat was not much better. He reprimanded himself for not thinking about bringing bottled water. He decided to partake of the drinking fountain, despite all the dire warnings about the local water supply. Pushing his body off the seat, he walked robot-like, stiff-legged, to the fountain|The reds and oranges mixed together in a fiery scene of passion and rage, her innermost sensations as she thought of the pain and hurt of her current situation. She knew while painting the picture, she wouldn't sell it. These paintings were for her to keep or to destroy.

Not long after the car accident which left her with the scars, she'd begun to paint|This could be over soon. What about the case in Arizona?"

"I can't count on that. We have no idea how it'l go down. Even if she's their lead suspect, they have to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."

"Maybe she won't be able to make bail|Nothing sweet about it anymore, the tree was burned like everything else around Loramendi, huge and skeletal as a great bone hand clawing up from the earth. There had been charred orbs swaying in its boughs, and Karou hadn't understood what they were until she'd heard some soldiers talking of using "the arza fruit" for archery practice.

She hadn't even thought-stupid, stupid-before saying, "Oh, that's fruit|My future had seemed pretty bleak and undoable until Seth showed up. Maybe every kind of species did better working together.

"Who's scary?" Tristan asked pulling me into a hug. His arms went around me with decidedly less fervor than usual and I realized it actually felt kind of awkward with other people watching us.

"Stella," Piper replied, nudging me in the arm with her elbow after I stepped away from Tristan|"I don't hurt at all."

He shook his head. "No. Because you weren't seriously injured."

The sound of my ankle cracking came back to me. "Are you sure? I remember...the way it bent. No. Something must be broken." I manage to sit up, so I could look at my ankle|When he woke again, Mareth was sitting in the chair next to his bed. His dad was asleep on a cot. A couple of nurses propped Gregor up a bit with pillows and brought him some broth. Mareth volunteered to feed him, and the nurses accepted and dashed off.

"The hospital staff is still working around the clock," said Mareth|On my way out the door, I grab my keys and purse and I'm gone. With no clue where to go, I drive. Drive and drive until I'm sitting at a stop sign by the middle school. There's a track right behind it.

I jerk into the parking lot, park and head straight for the track|The light grew brighter the more it fed on the landscape, gray smoke beginning to cloud the stars.

"It is a shame to hear about that whole West divorce nonsense," Mrs. Thatcher told me as she put her groceries up on the conveyer belt. It was a slow enough day that I was grateful to have her in my line|“Visions . . . Arms . . . ”
When he’d gone a great distance into the garden, his finger paused their action as his eyes focused on the gazebo to his left. Laughter. Tears. But Espers and earth? Setzer stepped toward the gazebo; his feet paused on the first step. He leaned to the left, looking around and to the side of the gazebo|Love is when you’re at your worst and that someone is still there, believing in you, having faith and you, and seeing you as the most beautiful person on earth.” She smiled lightly.
	Blake smiled as well, “That was beautiful.” He said.

 “A bit of - you call that a bit of a mud|Solharn laughed, and gathering together all the evil he could muster from inside himself, he lunged at the Creator and shot a torrent of black energy coursing with evil from his gaping mouth. Solharn hoped the energy would weaken the Creator allowing him the chance to overtake him, and send the Creator himself into the abyss. The plan failed miserably as Solharn was no match for the Creator|"Why do you have Pete's name tattooed on your neck?" I ask.

He grins widely. "When we were twelve, our dad still couldn't tell us apart. So, he decided to tattoo our names on our necks." He smiles even more broadly. "When he sat us down in the chair, he asked which one I was, and I said Pete|"There's another entrance to the concert hall, a catwalk that looks down over the whole area."

"How do you know that?" Alexei asked.

"Because I got totally bored during last year's concert, so I decided to go exploring with Samson. We paid one of the sound guys three hundred bucks to let us go through the control room and onto the catwalk|As I said, according to this town, I’m going to be Robert Adam Madigan or Ram.

“The scumbag’s gone,” said Roke noting that Deeter had come to and escaped.  “Should have tied him up.  Now we’ll have to find our own way out of here.”
“I almost forgot about him,” said Joel.
“Me too, I guess,” said Roke|My mom pushed me toward him, but he didn't take my hand. We didn't hug or kiss. The fire somehow was still between us, and neither of us moved toward the other, afraid we might get burned.

He reached for the journal|Sofia was standing a few steps away from me, her eyes downcast as she held the lantern in her hands. I wondered what was going on in her mind as she began to whisper something toward the lantern. I strained to hear what she was saying:

"Wherever you are, Vivienne, I hope you're alright."

After we let go of the lanterns, I couldn't keep my eyes off of Sofia|Whereas Tanner Kingsley was brimming with vitality and intelligence, Andrew Kingsley appeared to be slow-witted and apathetic. He spoke haltingly and seemed to have trouble putting sentences together.

"Here are those-you know-those notes you asked for, Tanner. I'm sorry I didn't finish-finish them earlier." "That's perfectly all right, Andrew|Sade, what’s wrong?” Cisco looked like a lost fawn as he followed her down the kitchen steps. When Sadie picked a coat from the hook by the door, Cisco tried holding her back. But Sadie needed some time alone to analyze what she was feeling. Yelling at someone wasn’t how she normally dealt with misunderstandings, but she just did it to Cisco|Blake was so startled he tried to rise up off the floor, stupidly forgetting he was still under the bed.  He soundly smacked his head against the box springs with a hollow sound.

"Merv arranged a connection of your office phone to your bedroom," replied Marilyn|"How are you enjoying life knowing I will never be able to come for you?"

He didn’t get any further. Jordan squeezed the trigger. There was a faint ting as the tin can was struck. The can ducked beneath the surface then did a little hop into the air.

“I’m in the bathroom across from your room, Chrissy|The doctor was waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs, impatiently drumming his fingers upon the rail. Apparently he did not think there was enough "snap" in my "to." As for myself, I was not looking forward to the rest of the evening.

At the sound, Amanda bowed her head reluctantly, as did Dawson|Against that black canvas, a few ruddy glows dotted the forest, like tiny campfires. They would've been easy to miss during the day.

Random memories of Piper moving to my side of the booth, her hands sliding up my thighs, her tongue in my ear. My stomach lurched and I turned, only to stumble over a random guy sleeping at the bottom of the villa's master stairs. I felt ill, and not from the liquor|That had been a stupid thing to say under the circumstances.

I mean, she wanted you," I said to Alexander, "and then you," I said to Sebastian|Abby felt her body jerk as if she'd been struck at the same time the room started spinning. She heard Jenny's voice come at her from far away asking if she was okay. Abby blinked several times and with a good deal of effort, she focused on Jenny.

Jenny got even closer and whispered back, "He all but told me, Abby|"Katrina is fine, but the day we have been preparing for has arrived," said the Guardian.

Is there any way that you could find them and get a message back to me?"
"Yes, of course I will, Charles|Any star guarded by a warrior is guaranteed publicity. I think some people are making things up just so they can be escorted."

"That has been my experience," Frost said. The unnamed muscle standing closest to him flinched. What stories had Ethan been telling the others about the Unseelie?

When he got off the phone, he winked at her and grinned. He tore into his sandwich and downed his water, then went back to the counter to fill both of their glasses. 
After they finished the second glass of water, a dusty, red Bronco pulled up in front of the cafe|He stared at the Moorra that had a male form but had long black hair of a female with a face that seemed familiar like he had seen before making him confused to that feeling. 
Tom frowned as the male spoke wording sounding odd to him in a male like voice tone that sounded like "I'm Jacin. I surrender. Who are you?"
He found himself understanding the male's talk to his shock to blurt "I'm Tom|"So do I. That's not the point. She's trying to pass her stuff off like it's freaking Stella McCartney."

"And that's a crime?"

I affected a solemn face. "Absolutely. You've gotta take revenge."

"I told you, I'm not interested in revenge|Coach Andrews had Augie sit next to him on the first seat of the bus.  He asked, “Did this come on all of a sudden?”
“No, I haven’t felt good all day.”
“You were in school?  Did you go to the nurse?”
“No, I think it’s the flu|“Probably a dead warrior from one of the old wars. They make great scouts. If you can find one with an ounce of brains left in him, that is.”
   “Males almost always make stupid ghosts.” She added in a quiet aside to me. “They almost never bring any skills with them into the afterlife|Their mission had four parts: (1) find Russian antiques they could get their hands on, (2) find cronies that would help in the purchase or theft of these items, (3) surreptitiously get these items into large shipping containers and onto ships bound for the States, and (4) make contact with newly rich Russians who hated Russian winters as much as he did, and convince them Charleston was the place for them to spend a few months each year.  As he delineated the mission, Roger wrote it down in short bullet points on the easel pad, then sat down on the sofa next to Gwen, and the three of them looked at the easel|The little man came towards Rincewind, dragging the girls.

'Have you met my daughters?' he said. This is Rincewind, who-'

'We have had the pleasure,' said Butterfly, gravely. 'How did you all get here?' said Rincewind. 'We fought as hard as we could,' said Butterfly|And then he dragged Emily away, her feet increasing their pace to a near run in an attempt to keep up with his long strides.

"Where are we going?" she asked, dodging a footman.

"To find Beatrice."

"Why?"

"Because I am thoroughly annoyed with you, Emily|"Good, we'll have time to eat supper and clear it away beforehand. And we'll have all day tomorrow to clean the house. I haven't cleaned that area rug in a year, I bet!"

"Gran, we're talking about a guy who sleeps in the ground all day," I reminded her. "I don't think he'd ever look at the rug|I didn't entirely understand her whole background, but apparently she was the younger daughter of some noble and had ended up in a military career as part of Dorian's guard.

"Lady Markham," she returned. Mild curiosity showed on her face. "What can I do for you?"

"Oh, nothing. Just thought we'd...you know, talk|I sat down, and folded my legs under me, my gaze fixed on the round window. The air was still. I sat alone, in the hallowed space, feeling lost and helpless. Defeat was beckoning me. I slumped forward. The scrolled canvas poked me in the chest.

Reaching into my jacket, I removed the canvas|Ruth stood, anxious now to see her grandmother before they left. "I'd better check on her."

Ruth went to her grandmother's room to find her resting fitfully. Helen's eyes fluttered open when Ruth stepped quietly past the threshold.

"Have I shocked you?" Helen asked, holding out her hand to Ruth|What did that make it, apart from impossible?
“Can you think of anyone who might have wanted to harm you?” Paddington asked.
“No.”
“What about Thomas?”
Richard shook his head. “That’s just harmless fun.”
“Last week you crossed his rainwater and septic tank lines in the name of fun|She carries the sheet to the sink and tries to angle it so that the water won’t get on the cookies. The flames lengthen and travel toward the cookies and her hair.
Run the water now!
She turns the tap on and hesitates.
Now! Now! Pour the water on now!
She shoves the angled sheet under the running water and soaks the flames and some of the cookies|“I didn’t recognize you at first. You hair was so blonde then—of course, this brown is a good color too.”
Her face went askew, thoughtful, and she said, as if she and Danny were sharing secrets, “I like the brown better myself.” She patted his shoulder and with a small wave to Aunt Polly, and left us to the room, after casting one quick glance back at Danny|A moment later, the older Colter brothers appeared at the vehicle, their expressions worried and grim as they took in the wreckage.

"Are you hurt, son?" Adam asked. "Where are Lauren and Liam?"

"No, sir, I don't think I'm injured that badly. Just can't move my legs but I can feel them."

Then he quickly related the events that occurred right after the wreck, and Liam's departure to go after Lauren|"What?" At the moment everything felt hopeless.

"A temporary position has been posted at the shipyard," Nate told her. "One of the clerks just had a baby and she'll be out for five months. The job requires basic computer and administrative skills. Do you think you might want to apply|Ellen set down the needles and yarn and stumbled toward her room, yawning every step of the way.

"Call me when you're ready for your prayers, sleepyhead."

"Oh...kay."

A few minutes later, Ellen called out that she was ready. They followed the same routine as when Ellen lived with her grandmother, which meant that Anne Marie listened to the girl's prayers|When Chris came back into the room she said, "I know why she flew out of here so fast.”
“Why?  Was it something I said?” I asked.
“No, she was about to leave before you came out of the room.  She saw me looking at a picture she had taken out of her wallet,” said Chris|“I’m sorry about that, miss, but I’m going to have to write you both up. Everyone is supposed to be inside for the service at this time,” the R.A. said, pulling out a pink pad from the pocket of his khakis. 

“Look, we’re really sorry but we weren’t skipping out on the service|“Or supposed to be trying to get some.” Aaron agreed. He shook his head again, then bent over and picked up the sword. “Anything, really. Some of those staffs have been trying to break the gate for centuries now. They and their ghosts were keen to get anything done.”
   “You're surrounded with demon-ghosts again, Aaron|Angus followed, finding it difficult to maneuver over all the uneven rocks, but it didn’t seem to bother Fane who walked as if he knew every level place to step. 
Fane sat on a rock inside the cave and plucked a few notes. 
Nothing happened.  
Vanora, busy studying the cave wall, turned her attention to Fane|When they had passed the fresh-water lake and reached the other side, Matilda saw something amazing. There appeared to be a wall of green glass and through it she could see her room. It was just as it had been when Maximilian had 'shrunk' her so that she could pass into the crystal ball.
“This time we reverse the spell,” said Maximilian|The Director said with a viciousness that startled both Danish and Rusty.
"Oh there you are!" Came a voice from behind them.
Rusty perked up. Her eyes lit up with a smile as Betty came over from the entrance and sat down next to the Director and her. She reached out and offered her hand to the Director|Now be quiet and let me do my work.”
Quinlan resigned to watching her apply her lithe hands to Donal’s ankles. The squire gasped once and passed out. Quinlan peered closely as white-blue magic infused under the wounded flesh. Any taint of darkness slowly faded. Songbird stretched and rubbed her hands together. She gave Donal a reassuring pat on his head and turned back to Quinlan|"Ryan, please."

He pulled away. "Turn around."

She turned blindly, giving him her back.

"Brace your hands against the wall and lean forward."

"Ryan?"

"You can trust me, Fin."

Fin nodded. She'd never trusted anyone more than she did Ryan|"Just so we're clear," he says, "I wasn't, like, trying to steal you away from Kurt when I asked if you wanted to go to the store with me. I was trying to, you know...be your friend. I don't want you to think I'm a creep."

I smile up at him. "I don't think you're a creep|At once, "she addedfirmly, and turned on her heel to lead him into hislibrary.

Daniel followed curiously, vaguely amused at the way his sweet, slightly connivingmother was storming ahead of him. But hishumor turned toshock themoment he closed thelibrary door andshe whirledon himina fury.

"I have never beensodisappointed inyouin mylife, Daniel|With a shuddering groan the front section of the inn collapsed, sending up a swirling cloud of sparks. Montrose took a few steps back as part of the porch caved in as well. His view of Queltin and the Ghostwalker was completely blocked. Had they been caught in the flames?
He raced back down the street, splashing through a large puddle as he came to the front of the burning inn|The black cloud floated in the middle of the street, somehow more bloated than it had been a minute ago.
Then Michelle screamed. Carda looked over his shoulder and his heart froze. A tentacle curled around Michelle's waist and lifted her out of the car, reeling her into the darkness.
Indal threw off his handcuffs and hurled himself out of the car, transforming in midair, and caught hold of the tentacle|He remained warm to the touch, but his breathing grew even and regular, and she hoped that solid sleep would cure whatever this ailment was. A knock at the door an hour later forced her to gently remove him from her lap and admit Lucian into the room. He handed her a plate of food as his gaze drifted to Justin's sleeping form.

"He really is sick," said Lucian|She could feel the chill passing her skin as the cool air of the room touched it. He took his left hand and pulled the covers around her body, covering her as he pulled the shirt over her right shoulder exposing the wound. Laying her back down, he tended to the dressing. He never took his eyes off of the wound|She snorted. "I'm the only person in this car who is safe from the Reaper."

We all sat there silently, realizing she was right.

"That's exactly why you should go home," I pointed out, using her reasoning against her. "You've already suffered enough at the hands of the Reaper|She was out of ammunition.
The farmer bent down and scooped up the fallen man's gun. He swung it up and flung it expertly at Mickey, who caught it, checked it was loaded, snapped it shut, brought it up and pointed both barrels at Bridie.
"Sorry about your friend," he said to the farmer|She hadn't exactly been in celebration mode after Nick left her cabin.

In fact, Jenna'd spent most of the day lying on a chaise on the Verandah Deck, trying to get lost in the book she'd picked up in the gift shop. But she couldn't concentrate on the words long enough to make any progress. Time and again, her thoughts had returned to Nick|"As Noel's uncle and godfather, it's Stephen's prerogative to have his country house overrun with parents who'll stay for a week and expect to be entertained, children's party or no."

"I suggested Stephen give your mother's sixtieth birthday ball at Montclair instead, and let us have Noel's birthday party at Claymore. Since her birthday is only three days after Noel's, that seemed the best plan."

"Clever girl," Clayton replied, instantly reversing his opinion of who ought to have the party|Wondering what she had said, then, in her most knowledgeable, womanly voice, she teased, Well, then—hey, honey, are you gonna take me to Las Vegas?  I told you I would, John answered, noticing with pleasure her use of the word, "honey," which she had picked up from him (it was so cute!).  Just as soon as I got a new job, I said we would go to Vegas|"Not without you!" Smith refused.

"Don't be stupid. You've got Tremont to finish off. I can take care of myself."

At the sounds of feet approaching through the trees, the big Doberman stopped its loping trot and spun back to join Peter. He spoke low to the dog, then looked back at Smith|He breathed out, his breath puffing her hair into her face. “You know were circumstances different, we would be sleeping in a Scottish bed this night. Man and wife over a blacksmith’s anvil.”
She took that pretty thought and held it to her heart. She never would have but it was a pretty thought|It was a wobbly, unbalanced failure, and it tore at Nick's heart. As always, Sally made him think of his mother, and all the excuses she'd made for alcohol over the years. "Oh, no, not my Chuckie. He gets a little frustrated, is all."

"I'm going to take Chuck in this time, Sally|Because of this, after MASAL was defeated, the Vuduri banned robots from their culture forever.

Of course, as we find out in Rome's Revolution, MASAL did not really die. He went into hiding beneath the dormant volcano Kilauea and drew from its thermal heat enough power to maintain his systems for over a century. It took Rei and Rome, using the weaponized VIRUS units, to set off Kilauea and vaporize MASAL|At least I am not losing my head over a girl."

"No, you're just missing one."

"True. Very true." He patted my back again. "Get some sleep, Liam."

"I can't."

"You have to. You need your strength. Your job is to protect Charlotte, and you cannot do that job if you do not rest|“Done deal,” said Joel.  He tossed up another candy bar.  
The voice laughed again.  “I like you,” it said. “You’ve got a sense of humor.  Not all cavers do.  Except I can see you’re no caver.  Where’s your gear?”  
“I need a light and a helmet and a jacket,” said Joel|I am here to know her past not her present. I quickly move through the kitchen ignoring the many draws and cupboards. My first priority is her laptop, which has been moved from the kitchen table. I enter the hall and pass the woman who I barely acknowledge. Into the study and straight to the desk where I find the laptop|Hugh turned toward the deep voice and saw Remington standing behind his desk, his famous blue eyes lit with amusement as he waved a hand toward one of the chairs that faced him.

"How did you know where I was?" Hugh asked crossly as he took a seat.

"You owe me one hundred thousand quid, my lord. I'm not likely to misplace you."

Hugh scowled. "A drop in the bucket for you, Remington|"Visiting - friends, did you say? Or relatives?"

"Yes," said Damon.

"You're lucky to be able to take off whenever you want," Elena said. She didn't know what was possessing her, to make her try and unmask him.

"Luck has very little to do with it," said Damon|“Now get over here and let me introduce you.”
	Dizzy dropped his backpack and walked over to his mom and Steve. Ana was walking closely behind him, acting shy for the first time in her life. 
	“Steve, this is my son Dizzy and my daughter Ana,” Michelle began. “Dizzy and Ana, this is Steve|I tried to continue to show Stormy around, but within a few moments, my mom was inside.

"I wasn't sure you'd be home," she said, holding several reusable bags filled with groceries. Then she noticed Stormy. "I didn't know you had company."

"Mom, this is Alexander's sister, Stormy|"You can be designated drivers."
"Or you can call the bail bondsman, should the necessity arise," added Michael. "Besides, you’re not boring."
Jared turned to me. "C'mon, let's go. We can celebrate our two-month anniversary."
"That’s an occasion," said Michael|“Tim, what can you tell us of the breaking development happening right now in front of your very eyes.”
“Well, Nick, I was visiting Disneyland with my girlfriend and her kids when someone blew up the castle.”
“Were you in the castle?”
“No, Nick, no one was in the castle|We should not rent vehicles and avoid the city’s people to prevent witnesses of knowing our whereabouts. We shouldn’t make it easy for SOUP to find us. We must maintain a low profile. We’ll have to visit a market and buy a few supplies to set up camp in the desert. This will expose us a bit, but there is no other way to get supplies|The other thing that helped me resist temptation was the prospect of being allowed to go to the hospital with Mam and Blod to bring Bickerstaff home. Having seen what the poor man had been through, it seemed selfish to risk putting myself back in a sickbed when I should’ve been there to help him. 
The other decision was to tell Blod what had happened to Bickerstaff|He had never enjoyed such wonderful food as his aunt fed him, nor so much of it.  Patting his stomach, Dean thought, “I must have added 20 pounds.  Boy, I could really be rough in a rumble now!”
“Rumble - - street war - -gang fight,” he thought.  “It’s funny; it’s been weeks since I thought of the gang|Aden thought of everyone else he knew with green eyes. A lot of names came up. What if, when a human shifted into werewolf form, his eyes changed color? Aden was living proof that eyes could change hues in the blink of, well, an eye. If that was true, anyone could be the werewolf|Pierce, as usual, was looking at his feet as he walked, with his hands in his pockets. The man next to him had a portly build and appeared to be going bald. In the moonlight, it was possible to make out what looked like a birthmark on his forehead.
Chambers emerged from behind a parked car and followed them into the garage. She padded silently, listening to them mutter back and forth about paranoia, until they were in the darkest area of the garage|He looked at Ari again. "And I don't hate you. That," he leaned into her now, his eyes roaming her face, "is why I am doing this to you."

"Out of guilt," she curled her lip in anger. "You're doing this because of your own guilt|Cwimson dwagons are gway under all their scales. Wed dwagons are wed under their scales and do not have this gway stwipe. Some say wed dwagons are angry all the way thwough, which is why they are the fiewcest.”
Mermin handed the scale back to Andy. He could just make out a light gray band along the bottom of the scale where it would have been attached to the dragon|Damon tilted his head, staring at her, his midnight-black eyes unreadable. "I know you want to think I'm a good person, Elena," he said slowly. "But I didn't help Meredith through the change, and I didn't protect her. She wouldn't have thanked me if I had."

Without really meaning to, Elena leaned closer to Damon|Are you insane? Everyone knows you’re only supposed to use pony.”
“I thought,” Tome replied, “you were supposed to use the hair of an Anasasi maiden, cut off under a full moon on the night she reaches womanhood?”
“Oh really? Do you see any Anasasi maidens around here, Tome|Let me get you something to drink."

For the first time, I saw Dana off guard. I was not the Tabitha she knew, and she didn't know how to handle it.

Bastien stood in the kitchen, invisible, arms crossed defiantly over his chest. I winked at him and then turned back to Dana|"I'm Victor," he said and reached out his hand to take hers. "And you're...?"

"Lana. Lana Armstrong," she said her confidence returning, even if it was still a little weak. She took another sip of the martini and actually enjoyed it this time. "So what do you do, Victor|Chadwick looked at Lucinda with one eye squinched, and his mouth drawn in. “At least we tried. Maybe you can pray. Since this is the chapel, maybe somehow things will work out. I’ll see you tomorrow,” he said.
“Yes, I’m willing to try anything. Thanks for trying. I’ll see you,” she said as she walked into the chapel|“Hello, your grace,” Beatrix mumbled and stood, placing her hands behind her back. Berty scrambled over to her sister, standing slightly behind her as if still afraid.
“I give up! Where are—oh.” Bethanny’s cheeks flushed crimson and she nodded to Charles and Graham. “Your grace, sir. Um, please forgive us for interrupting—”
The sound of the clipping of heels on the marbled hall floor had all three girls glancing to the hall, then to Charles|Piper ran toward the front door, heading toward the grassy area to the right of the driveway that had a few hardy flowers and a metal swing set that had been dropped off by one of Danny's cousins the day before.

It amazed Amanda that his family and friends had just come to his aid, no questions asked. Nothing was brand new, but they had all cleaned out their closets and garages and given him clothes and toys for Piper.

Piper paused at the door and turned toward Amanda|"She hasn't told us. And she tells us everything. Or she did." Della shot Kylie a frown.

"She doesn't tell us everything," Miranda piped up. "Just like some people with hickeys don't tell us everything."

Della scowled at Miranda and then looked at Kylie|"Nancy isn't any too happy about me seeing you, either."

"I'll talk to her, explain everything." Except that, like Lindsey, Steve's sister probably wouldn't be too pleased.

"It's settled, then," Steve said. "I'll talk to Lindsey and you'll talk to Nancy|“I’m sure there’s an explanation beyond our comprehension, Jenny,” he said gently, his squeezing hand reminding her of her manners. She looked at Aaron with narrowed eyes and pursed lips before turning her attention to her husband.
“I’m sure you are right,” she reluctantly agreed.
Father smiled at her gently before turning to look at Aaron|She called Gina first, relieved when her friend answered sounding perfectly fine.

"Gina? Are you all right?" Jo asked anyway.

"Jo?" Gina asked, and then said, "Yeah, sure I am. Why wouldn't I be? How was the party?"

Jo blinked at the question and then asked uncertainly, "The party|Two weeks after the market, Tommy Forester proposed marriage to Bridget Comfrey, and she accepted. And the week after that, Mrs. Hempstock came to visit Mrs. Thorn of a morning. They took tea in the parlor.

"It is a blessing about the Forester boy," said Mrs. Hempstock.

"That it is," said Mrs. Thorn|She did know that she was happy to be out of the safe house which was riddled with bullets now.  They were headed back to the precinct where she’d get to see even more police.  It’s not that she wasn’t grateful for all they had done for her.  She just wanted the nightmare to end.  They escorted her to an interrogation room when they arrived at the precinct|Is it true that you can only count up to five?'

'We just thought that it might save people getting hurt,' said Cohen. 'You thought it would save you getting hurt,' said the warlord. 'I daresay a few of yours might get hurt, too.'

'They're peasants,' said the warlord|She also hoped there were enough people in the diner to keep the elders from confronting her if they hadn’t.
Alyssa forced herself to walk quickly across the street not wanting to draw attention. She shifted Samantha in her arms, opened the glass door to the diner and went inside. Samantha buried her face in her mother’s shoulder hiding from the bright light of the diner|She'd be a third wheel," she whispered.

Stormy squirmed. I could tell she was struggling with including me in her and Luna's adventure.

"I think we vampire girls should stick together," Luna said, her pink lips triumphantly stretching across her porcelain face.

Stormy took a breath and looked up at Luna|I hear we are having baby back ribs!” I laughed as Dylan jumped off the bed and headed for the door.
“Wait, Dylan!” I called after him. He turned around. “I’m just curious. How come you’re just a puppy? I mean, Eli is a fully grown eagle, and Star is a fully grown tiger, why are you a puppy|"Oh-" Lucas stopped him with a single word. "There's trouble at the Johnson site."

"Warren again?" Sean frowned.

"Yeah, they dug without the okay and hit a water pipe. Apparently the home owner can now dock a boat off the patio."

Shaking his head, Sean said, "I know the crews are your department, but if you want my opinion, we ought to get rid of Warren|If he suspected that he himself had a gravitonic brain, and gravitonic brains were being shipped to the Limbo Project...He ran a search over his visual memory, searching for more instances of the words or the lightning symbol. There, on a notebook on the counter. And on a file folder, and two or three other places about the lab.

It was obvious that not only he, Caliban, but Leving Labs had something to do with the Limbo Project|“The great Emperor Tom Holloway Anders has never been to the bar, but I’ll tell the girls to take the important tables if we get any, okay? You can make more than one trip to the tables when you drop off the food, so the tray won’t be as heavy as you think. The girls’ll show you.”
“But Baird, I…I don’t know how to be a waitress|"I guess he'll straighten out after he's been back for a while..."  She paused and looked up at Ben, who was still standing.  "But I don't know why I'm telling all this to you.  Sit down and we'll talk about something else."
Ben sat down on the log beside her and said, "Nights are different out here.  The air smells different, and there's more stars|"Call them, all of them," he demanded, "every person who's involved in this fiasco. I want them at my office tomorrow at noon."

"What?" Abby asked. "Why?"

"Do it," Cash returned.

Abby's eyes slid to the digital clock on the microwave then back to Cash|Swiftly, using the mirabhasa placative mode, Edric tried to smooth over the moment. "Scytale, you told us you sold Hayt because you shared our desire on how to use him."

"Edric, you will remain silent until I give you permission to speak," Scytale said. And as the Guildsman started to protest, the Reverend Mother snapped: "Shut up, Edric|“What if I said I’ve been going for runs at the beach for my health?”
Todd suddenly looked worried, “You okay dad?”
“I’m good,” Tom smiled broadly. 
“It’s definitely a woman then. Is she a lot younger than you? Cause that would be, um… weird|"I need a haircut, er uh yuh . . ."
"At's what you gotta tell me?"
"Nuh, I need duh haircut today," he remonstrated, "not a week from today duh way you get haircuts."
"Yeah, you wish you had a fifth uh my haircuts:  you could make a hand puppet outta four fingers."
"What would I do wid a four-finger hand puppet|‘No he hasn’t’, said Louie.
‘Good’, said Pearl. ‘To help me get this thing worked out in my mind could you arrange for Virgil to get six of his wasps to pick up Arnold from the Reserve Bank and to meet us at the tunnel in half an hour? Tell him we just want to show him the tunnel|I take a step back-toward the crowd, toward Elder.

"What did you say?" Dad already sounds angry.

"I'm not going." I don't leave any room in my voice for doubt.

Dad strides forward, twin infernos in his eyes. "For him?" he asks furiously, pointing over my shoulder to Elder|"You're interested in the orchard?" She seemed surprised.

"I walked up there the other day. It's really peaceful and beautiful." Not to mention that Sam and I spent precious 'alone time' there.

She got a wistful look in her eyes. "Your father always enjoyed working in the orchard|The two sets of codex leather coats floated on the surface, further obscuring his view of the shoreline. 
Fergus realized he had lost his battle with the elements. He stopped struggling and simply sat in the submerged curach and waited for death. He hoped it would come quickly. It soon became apparent to him, that it would not be quick|The vortex enlarged, and as the men gazed at the phenomenon, the bridge of the Telenian appeared on the other side. 
“One at a time now… Go, go, go!” he commanded. 
One by one, the soldiers entered the vortex and disappeared, crossing over to the Telenian. With the last man crossing over, Jhovahkan collapsed at the same time as the vortex|I could see the two of us standing there in the woods and how we were connected by a band of energy - a silver cord that hummed and sang and bound us heart to heart. And I understood that it could never be broken, that our lives were linked."

Cassie remained silent, looking at Diana with sympathetic eyes.

"I know it sounds crazy," Diana said, "but I trust him, Cassie|"When I heard you and Johanna were engaged, I called my mother and asked her to unearth those projects from a trunk I'd stored in the attic."

"You kept the project?" Stunned, he was glad he had the door at his back for support.

"All four seasons," she confirmed. "I got them framed, to be a wedding gift to you and Johanna|I tried to focus, but I found myself reading the same sentence again and again. My head was muzzy with champagne, and my feet still felt cold and waterlogged from the lake. Mal might be back from his card game. If I knocked on his door and he answered, what would I say?

I tossed the book aside. I didn't know what to say to Mal|"Of course." I laughed. Laughing felt good-it deflated my anxieties. We kept going, making stupid pirate sounds and overplaying lamely off the joke while not wanting to give it up.

"Sebastian, I've never seen you act so friendly," remarked Emory.

"Because when I'm not acting, I'm not acting," said Sebastian|Then, slowly, putting her cheek against his, she said, "I'm afraid that this is just a dream."

"I'l tel you a secret, princess," he said into her ear. "You and I are the only real things here. It's everything else that's the dream|"I've done a little bit of work with camps in the past, but just guest visits. Nothing of my own. It was fun. And there are a lot of kids out there who can't afford the extras."

"And you miss football," Asha added, knowing Kade missed being involved in the sport. "You have a lot to give, Kade|"Although I don't know what you'd find to interest you. My body isn't beautiful like yours."

"Of course it is," she said in surprise.

He arched an eyebrow skeptically. "My body is big and ugly and hairy-like all men."

"Your body is big and beautiful and, yes, hairy|I knew something was wrong.” Terra clutched his hands. “Setzer, won’t you tell me? I know I don’t understand about love and all its problems, but I’m your friend. I want to help.”
Setzer released a deep breath. “There’s nothing for you to do, Terra|I'd known my siblings were safe, and that I would be seeing them again. I'd had a nice, loving boyfriend. I had been certain that if enough time passed I would come to love him one day, because who wouldn't love Bret? Every other girl in the school loved him, except for me.

Wrapped within Cade's arms I began to understand why I'd never been in love with Bret|Mykolas obeyed with a grin, and he let out a grunt of pleasure as Velvet's soft hands rubbed oil on his back.

Mykolas' back was smooth, hard and all sculpted muscles. Velvet would never admit it to a living soul, but she loved giving Mykolas a massage, loved the feel of his sinewy muscles reacting to every stroke of her fingers.

Mykolas turned his head to the side so he could watch Velvet|----------
Rod was already at the bar, with a sizeable group around two tables with high bar stools, when Tim arrived. He was followed by two men in their mid to late 40’s, wearing just bush-singlets, shorts, despite the cooler air, and low-cut gumboots. They were obviously brothers.
“This is Bill and Ben I was tellin’ you about,” said Tim|"And now we must speak these words as one, so I might go back to my lands and vanquish my enemy."

She looked from side to side, before spewing forth words that sounded to him vaguely like some form of Germanic, but not a dialect he recognized. Why would this dark woman be speaking to him in Germanic|"We stick together."

"We'll all go," Monk said, but he turned to Jada. "Maybe you'd best stay with the helicopter."

She considered it for a few seconds, then shook her head, forcing as much bravado as she could muster. "I've not come all this way to stay in the helicopter|He tried to keep the chick-like anxiety out of his voice.

"It's stupid." She shrugged, trying to blow him off. "I feel like a chick just thinking about it." He smiled. They were so alike in so many ways. "Uh... hate to tell you this, baby, but you are a chick|Michael slipped off his night vision goggles and turned the kitchen light on.  
"Who else is in the apartment?" Michael asked.
"No one, it’s just me here.  What do you want with me?" asked the mugger with insolence in his voice.
"I wanted to have a little conversation with you about Katrina Castillo," said Michael|If that much was simple spending money, then how much were they paying for the students to go to Armedius?

Joel didn't want to know.

"So, where does it go?" he asked. "Why work all these extra hours?"

She didn't look up. "Your father left more than a family behind when he died, Joel|"You're stuck with me for life."

"I know; maybe I'm crazy, but that makes me very happy." I laugh when he starts tickling me.

"Let's go home crazy girl."

"Let's go home and celebrate," I clarify.

"Oh, we're definitely going to celebrate|He knew that would change quickly. -

When the pizza was gone, he dismissed them and they scattered. Kaley lingered behind, as she had been doing in the past months. There was a rigid no-fly zone between faculty and students, and Ray Atlee was not about to venture into it. He was much too content with his job to risk it fooling around with a student|They said goodbye to Emily, and walked to the south side of the house where Tony had already set up targets for their quick draw practice.
“All right, boy, you ready to practice? I swear, last time I thought you was trying to outrun molasses. You were so slow that I think a turtle could outdraw you.” Tony’s eyes sparkled with laughter. He didn’t mean any harm, and Wade took no offense at the friendly ribbing that he had grown accustomed to since spending time with Tony|I was still on "beautiful." You always look beautiful.

"What?" I said finally. "No, I'm not dating Walter. But we made out Friday night."

Drew's frown deepened. I thought he might be just a little bit jealous. Hooray!

But then he said, "I have a lot of respect for Walter|Charlotte had obviously forgotten exactly when Bess Ferryman went to Stanford Suites; however, it must have been recent. "They're having an early Christmas bazaar, too," she said. "Some of the seniors have craft items for sale."

"How nice."

"When's the last time you saw Bess|In the early evening, they took a taxi back to the museum district, but this time walked directly to the adjoining streets leading to Abu Qatada’s residence. Peter felt awkward trying to look casual strolling toward the tree-lined boulevard fronting the executive mansions. There were no other civilians on the street and military vehicles blockaded traffic from entering.
“Josh, this isn’t normal.”
Continuing to walk, Josh said, “You’re creeping me out, Peter|He glanced at the prince who was staring at him with his mouth open and his sword point on the ground.
“I’ll take the body of my best friend and bury it. My group is leaving Burton at dawn so no one will be saying anything to anyone in Burton. As far as either of you are concerned none of this ever happened,” Fanchon said as he picked up Jerron’s shirt and handed it to the prince|Everett sat down across the table from Isabelle but barely raised his eyes from his lap. The way he could hardly look at Isabelle without blushing made Grant think that the guy had a bad case of the hots for her.

Not that Grant blamed him.

Keith showed up right on Everett's heels. He smiled at Grant and shook his hand, while offering hugs to the ladies and a hearty slap on the back to Everett|“I mean, for tonight,” said her father, backpedaling. “I know it’s hard, but the best thing is to try to get some sleep.”
“Oh,” said Cassie sheepishly. “I’m so tired, I think I’ll sleep okay. I just hope I don’t have nightmares|Every. Single. Day. And I will know if you don't. I will know, if for even one day, you forget to dance, because your body will show me.

"I don't want to see any of you in the wrong studio. I want you all to be in the right studio|Mother realized my predicament, because she started murmuring soothing words that didn’t quite register in my head. 
“...Why don’t we check the list of survivors?” She offered hesitantly, breaking through my haze. I briefly remembered someone inquiring my name and jotting it down on a piece of paper.
“Yes.” She helped me up gently and weaved her arm through mine, hunting down the person in control of the list|"And in those notices, there was one from two girls who needed a guy to ride with them to Birmingham. They were scared they'd have a flat tire or something, and I can at least change a flat tire. I think. Anyway, Britta never had one."

Britta. Hmm. "So they took you as far as Birmingham|If you remember, you were the one who wanted to take this to the next level, correct?"

I nodded.

"I kissed you, you kissed me back, things got a little intense. We both wanted it. Correct?"

I nodded again.

"And then, for reasons unknown to me, you freaked out and left my house, and now you are trying to come up with anything you can possibly come up with to get me to go away, even though you still want to be with me, based on the kiss|Another motto of mine.

Caleb pushes his hands in his pocket at starts walking. At least he has the conscience to look sheepish about it, even if it's in a 'whatever' kind-of-way.

I fall into step beside him, my arm brushing his. After jerking away, I totally realize I'm walking to school with Caleb|"I'll go tell him and then head back to the cottage to tell the wife and pack some drinks and snacks in a cooler. We'll meet you back here in ... say ... half an hour?" he suggested.

"Sounds good," Paul said at once.

Nodding, Russell moved off toward the Corbys' cottage.

"We'd best go inside and see to the feeding now then," Paul said quietly, taking her arm to usher her to the cottage|Finally, Michael became so small he just vanished, and Keech became so large he felt as though his head, so full of so many worlds, would burst.
Days would pass before Keech realized the full import of that moment. The papers, the files, the evidence that Michael had gathered had already been sent. The charges were already being filed. The little patchwork men, like dogs, would have their day. Michael didn’t have to die at all, if only he’d told Keech|I shook my head taking a step towards him, still not realizing what he was about to do. Collin looked at me one last time. His eyes never left mine, "I love you, Ivy Taylor." He breathed in deeply, turned his back to me, and launched his body into the pit.

Fear shot through me as I screamed, "Collin|Viktor looked at Louis. "You say wait. You say 'take your time.' But what if we die while we're waiting? What then? What would you think? Would you regret our having waited? I don't know the point anymore of waiting."

"You die to become this," said Louis|“I don’t have time right now, the cops are on my tail.”
He could feel her quiver—the bad boy wins again. “I need your car. And I need you to keep your mouth shut about me coming to see you.”
Without a second thought, she reached into the pocket of her short-shorts, which somehow could fit a pair of keys|Then Aaron did hear the bell ring and rose with the other students to leave the room at the end of class.
The school had a twenty minute break between second and third periods to allow for students to get to their lockers, get their books and homework assignments for the next two periods and get a drink or snack at the cafeteria. Aaron wasn’t hungry and he had no intention of going back to his locker|He could understand that she was mad that Rafe once again knew something she didn't know. It wasn't as if he'd wanted to keep it from her; it was just difficult always to have to think about what he could and couldn't say.

Everything was much simpler if people just didn't know. Of course, that wasn't an option when it came to Rafe|When she came up for air, Ethan had stopped in the center of the pool. The golden lights reflected off his cheekbones, showing off his slicked-back hair, angular face, and broad, golden shoulders. Ethan caught her eye and smiled back, but Emma quickly looked away. She didn't want him to think she was staring|“Seth…stop it…it’s me.”  I start to laugh.  I can’t believe I have a bird that talks just like Karen.  “Wake up Seth.”  I finally open my eyes all the way and see Karen standing right above me.  I start to laugh the bird looks just like Karen|And, perhaps you can chalk that up as a success of sorts. By his dictionary.”
“I still think you made him do it,” said Heather, back to her hands.
“I just said what either of you would have said, that it couldn’t be done.”
“That has not stopped Netoniel before,” said Heather|They were just coming around a bend when Zanas heard it, the roar of water hitting earth close by. She led them forward past a patch of the biggest plants she had ever seen. They were taller than Thomas, with thick stems that ended abruptly in an open flower. Although she would not entirely describe it as a flower|She didn't like imagining how badly he could hurt her friend, if given the chance. Ella was a very special person but Beth still felt like she would be out of her league with someone as worldly wise as Declan. He wasn't the right man for her.

"So I made sure Gray got Declan here just for you, Ella|"Good workout today." Tegan crosses his arms and leans against the building. This is the first time he's actually walked me out of the building.

"Thanks," I mumble, pulling my keys out of my bag. Then I start to walk away.

"Hey," he calls out to me and idiotically I stop|Petr turned to see who had spoken. 
A tall black-haired, dark-eyed, man leaned forward in his seat so that his face entered the beam of light shining through the window. His garishly large hook-nose had past-times been broken and badly reset. A large golden hoop dangled from his left ear. ‘I’m Kassim,’ he offered his hand to Petr|She flipped through her notes and bounced the eraser end of her pencil against her note pad, “The obvious first hypothesis is that the ex-wife burned the house in revenge for her husband refusing to give it to her in the divorce.” She looked up at the chief. “Have you interviewed her?”
“No. She's back in North Carolina now. I spoke to her on the phone. She said her lawyer told her to tell me she knew nothing about the fire|She was all curves and angles, graceful. At the moment, however, she looked a bit like a child with that smile.

"Can I ride with you?"

Jason palmed his keys. "You like the car."

She shook her head. "No, I'm fascinated by the way you drive|"If you really are making the offer, Nicolas, you know I'm always willing to do business with your family. I could use the extra acreage and I certainly have enough men to run both spreads."

"Colby is never going to agree," Paul whispered to Rafael. "You know she won't. She'll be furious."

"You let me take care of that, Paul|I glanced at the clock and willed the next two hours to pass quickly.

* * *

Ten minutes left until my shift ended and Sam still wasn't there. Usually by now, he was, but Logan called and asked him to pick him up so he could get some ice cream, too. So instead of being here, he was on his way to get Logan|Harlow spent the next few minutes checking out Lila Kate's toes and fingers and even her tummy. She checked everything. While I was helping her put socks on Lila Kate's little feet, the baby's little eyes fluttered open, and she puckered up.

"Hey, my precious baby, it's Mommy. I'm here," Harlow said. The puckered frown disappeared instantly, and Lila Kate gazed up at Harlow|“I hope there is more coming because that was not a good start.”
“But. . .”
George waited, still looking out the window.
Then he smiled.
He turned back to his brother, saw how Sebastian was trying, trying, to say something else.
George shook his head and laughed. “But. . .is a good enough start for me, Sebastian|"May I ask you a question? You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to. I don’t mean to be intrusive..."
"Ask anything," Darlene responded indifferently.
"What does your husband do? It seems that he is a man of power."
"He is not my husband anymore," said Darlene|What are you talking about?” I asked weakly. I hadn't even gotten fed yet and stayed marching on the treadmill. “Harvey? No dinner? But I like fish.”
   “No dinner. Exploding wizards are dangerous to keep around the house. Any idiot knows that.” Charlie winked at me, then pushed me off the treadmill|I know I was supposed to go straight to the hotel, and call him once I was settled, but I was too angry; to angry with him, and with myself. I'd been so naive to think that we could build a future when neither of us was over our past. I'd made one compulsive decision after another, and was left heartbroken and absolutely distraught.

Rusty called my phone until I finally answered.

"I can't talk to you right now, Rusty|“And the large force that he leads, which I was talking about, is none other than Force one, the group of thousand or so mystics that he commands.”

He turned and looked at a mortified Ion. “Now you see why I brought you along. Because more than being my apprentice … he’s your friend.”

Vonayz stood there as still as a rock, his eyes glued to Ion|Gerald mumbled something to another man outside the door about keeping watch. 
He could hear very well in the night but their voices were muffled by the loud music. He waited for their footsteps to grow faint. Then, with effortless force, he broke loose from the chains. Obviously, they did not know about his strength|“I’m fixing these.” 
Gage grabbed more cars and dumped them on the sidewalk. “You’re weird.”
Addy stuck her tongue out at him and started pulling the laces out of her shoes.
Gage watched her for a minute then crawled over to where she was sitting. 
“Stop being a pain and put your shoes back on, Addy|Before he had a chance to react to the fact that it was me, my mother shouted from the living room, "Don't let the kitten out!"

Dad stared at Rachel and then at me, and in the meantime, a brown tabby cat the size of a rabbit crept around the doorjamb and shot into the yard beyond us. I felt ridiculously betrayed by the presence of the cat|She needed a vacation, not a book tour. He thought of his ancestral home near Sitka, Alaska. The remote lodge, surrounded by cozy log cabins, was his favorite retreat in the world, and he had the insane urge to take her there so she could rest.

Ah, but they would do more than rest|“Well,” Evan said, “let’s go wave them down, they can help us.”
Lore hesitated. “I don’t know. We don’t know them, what if they’re not here to help? I think we should keep going. We can’t stand around here anyway, those things are getting closer.”
Both groups of sick people were closing in, dragging themselves toward her and Evan|A yard away it halted and ejected a carton wrapped in familiar plain brown paper; the carton lay at their feet and then at last Norm Schein bent and picked it up. It was not a phantasm. Cautiously Norm tore the wrappings off.

"Chew-Z," Mary Regan said breathlessly. "Oh, what a lot! How much, Mr. Eldritch?"

"In toto," Eldritch said, "five skins." The tractor extended a small drawer, then, precisely the size to receive the skins|'Why do you need secret policemen?'

'Because,' said Andre, 'sometimes you have secret criminals.' Granny almost smiled. 'That's a fact,' she said. She peered at the small engraving on the back of the badge. 'Says here "Cable Street Particulars"...'

'There aren't many of us,' said Andre|Zoe continued to sit in the living room, her feet propped up at the coffee table.
Ana said, “This also means that when you start school, you’ll have to do homework on your own. That goes for you, too, Zoe.”
“What school? I don’t speak Vietnamese,” said Zoe. 
“You’ll learn Vietnamese in school,” said Ana|He ached at the revelation. And, at the same time, he felt relieved. Elizabeth had found the kind of man she should marry.

And now...

Now.

Nick could run all night in the storm. Until his every shattered bone screamed for mercy.

But Nicholas Lawton couldn't outrun, could never outrun, his feelings for Elizabeth|She was so very lovely, so fresh and clean in her Red Cross uniform that she seemed like the breath of spring in our stuffy little Room.
On the second day she brought disquieting news. She had slipped out of hospital that morning to buy a few things in the town and she had been followed almost as soon as she left the hospital grounds. The man hadn't spoken to her nor had he taken much care to avoid being seen, but he had sauntered along behind her till she returned to hospital|“I’m a pilot,” he says. He doesn’t say it in a smug way, but when no one’s asking you what your occupation is, voluntarily contributing it to the conversation naturally comes off as smug. “I work at the same airline as Corbin.”

He’s staring at me, waiting for me to be impressed by the fact that he’s a pilot|"I'm afraid you'll find this small town is not what it used to be," she said to Kacey, "Many of the shops and restaurants have gone out of business. They all relied so much on the castle to bring tourists to town, that when it was taken over, no one came here anymore."
Emma and Ava looked at each other, and asked, "A castle|Noelle didn't sit on the couch. Neither did Thomas. They both kept standing. Noelle pulled a photograph from the manila file she carried, and she pushed it across the desk toward the senator. "Take a look at Jack, and tell me...have you seen him before?"

The senator's gaze darted down to the photo, then right back to Noelle|she asked as his car pulled out of line. Several vehicles passed him.

Toby silenced the mic. "He got hung out to dry." At her confused frown he explained, "The car behind Jay's bumped him out of place. He lost the draft. It slows him down and he falls back in the pack|“Relax, Leanne. I’ve got no intention of telling her how the switch is done. And it’s not like anyone will believe her if she blabs. Everybody thinks she’s nuts, her and her mother.” The Black Widow gestures to the table. “Can you hand me one of those daiquiris, Leanne|“You are a good man, Dylan of the Shed, you are doing this to help our Worlds, to help us. You and your Father,” she looked up at his Dad and his Dad smiled. 
He didn’t like that. Who did she think she was? He thought about the Deer Woman and his Mum. It seemed anything was possible here, so maybe it was possible to find his Mum|"Don't make excuses for him, David. He mistreated you, and you spent your life hating Jason for that."

"My hatred for my brother was not because of the mistreatment," he said. "It was because Father blamed me when Jason would step out of turn."

"Beat you when Jason would step out of turn|Smoke billowed around Eddie’s feet.
Despite his aversion to clubs, the atmosphere intoxicated him.  Called up primal instincts he forgot he had.  It cut through his apprehension, pulled at him, whispered to him.  Forget your troubles.  Come drink.  Come dance.  He supposed that was part of reason why he didn’t like clubs|"I don't think that will hold me, baby girl. I'm a big guy."

"Hairy too," she said with a perfectly straight face. "Like a gorilla. That's what Anita thinks."

"Hey!" Danny burst out laughing. "I am not hairy. And the hair I have is blond, so I'm nothing like a gorilla|"You say that because you don't know Borys Maslen. You just gave your daughter up to the devil."

At that, my father only laughed at me. "Why so tightly wound up, son?" He lightly slapped his palm over my cheeks as he staggered upwards, letting go of me. "The lad may be a self-absorbed brat, but he's no devil|"Aw, come on. It's fun. You'll be fine."

I start to back away. "I don't think I should."

"Can you swim?" he asks.

"Of course I can swim." I feel like saying Duh! Why would I be up here if I couldn't swim|They gave us extra room at a time during our history when we thought no more room existed. The human race, do you know, has always perceived personal space horizontally. Yet, no one had ever thought to view it vertically. That is the frontier we explore-the frontier of the sky."
Savannah didn't understand how the sky could be a frontier|I felt Leah's warm touch as she rubbed my back.

"You need to talk to her, Garrett. Give her a chance. Please. There are so many things you don't understand, so many things that aren't my place to tell you. You can't end a relationship like this, Garrett|“Yes, but I still wonder if we should ever find them on all of that ice.” 
Christy replied, “Losing them has been an adventure, but I think the Ice-Crystals belong to the ice now.” 
Christy’s mother began to wonder what had come over Christy and said no more.
Karston turned to Christy and smiled, “Yes, they belong to the ice|‘Who else awaits you, Kandrigi? Who else but the friend of your youth, Lamla?’
Kandrigi went forward into the room impetuously, his hands extended.
‘I have waited impatiently for many months for this moment, Lamla. Your friendship I have always treasured in my heart.’
‘It is good to hear that, Kandrigi|They kept to themselves, no doubt reading fine print in mortgage documents, and were treated as slightly inferior lawyers by the rest of the firm.

At Drake and Sweeney, each lawyer kept his current files in his office, often under lock and key. Only the retired files were accessible by the rest of the firm|“Rats,” Jason says as he sits, watching the sports highlights. 
“Feet,” I say, tugging on the blanket where he has propped his dirty work boots. He sighs and lifts his feet so I can snuggle beside him on the couch.  
“What do you mean, 'rats|'The chart wath my idea, Mithith Ogg,' said Igor proudly. 'The old marthter got fed up with people just hammering the thtaketh in any old where. He thed he didn't mind the dying, that wath quite rethtful, but he did object to looking like a colander.'

'You're a bright chap, aren't you, Igor|asked And turning from  the massive fireplace and rubbing his hands together in appreciation of the sudden warmth.
"I've just come from the tower," Harry said, entering the room and seating himself on the plush red velvet couch that stood in front of the fireplace.
"You don't say..." said And slowly twirling his long white moustache.  "And what, may I ask, did you find in the tower|They were also dressed in flowing silk robes, but their heads were uncovered. Their hair, long and braided, dangled down their backs. Each one clasped his hands together at the waist. Gregori figured they didn't use their hands much, not with fingernails that were about six inches long, curved and yellow.

Gross. From the look on Abigail's face, he could tell she agreed|I stared at her, wondering how she could possibly live life like it was a continuous game. I actually breathed an audible sigh of relief when Xavier and Sofia arrived. My gut clenched when I saw how Sofia's face paled at the sight of Emilia.

"She's back," Sofia croaked.

I was about to approach her and pull her into my arms, but I wasn't able to, because compassion immediately filled her green eyes at the sight of Emilia|Now on to item 2, the shortage of females on colony Green due to birth defects.  Who has that report?"  
Frederick answered, "I have it sir.  The environmental problem is identified, a virus.  Medical is working on it, but there is a ratio of 18% female to 82% male on the planet now.  The Albertson group suggest enticements to females on all our planets to emigrate to Green|“No clue,” Grant said, taking another spoon full of mashed cyntato. 
“What are you going to do as a warrant officer?” Gerald said. He couldn’t help not donning his fatherly investigation ritual: which as the others knew was a dramatic search and interrogation until something wrong could be discovered and scrutinized. 
“Operative missions, security, and officer’s assistant positions,” replied Grant|“Greco walked into study. He started talking about a journal and Tyler White. He started to say something about what happened to a girl but then it was like the shadows came alive and started choking him. The man in the chair told him never to talk about her. Then they started talking about descendants and that there might be a list of them in the back of the journal|I'm thinking it would be harder for me to get into your good graces once again, so I was requesting to be brought to Aiden instead. At least with him I have a history I can bank on."

"You broke his heart." I said bluntly.

She nodded. "I know. He didn't deserve that..." She paused. "I want another chance, Sofia. I have no one left in this world but you and Aiden|Her heart jumped and then slowed. It was so slow, the beat of her heart, and she was so weak, so dreadfully impossibly weak. Dying. Surely she was dying.

"Do you realize what this means, Rose, if you do this to me?" Gardner demanded. "You made a fool of me, Rose|I won't think about him again. I can't.

Monroe shakes his head. "It's not your time yet," he says.

"Do you have the itinerary? I seem to have lost mine."

"Don't be a smartass."

"It's what I do, Monroe|"You what, Ambrose?" Her eyes looked hopeful.

"I... It wasn't just a bet. It isn't just a bet anymore. This is about us, can't you see? It's more than a silly bet."

"A silly bet? Can I assume you're labeling me as the silly part of this bet|“Oh, don’t exaggerate,” said Monson dismissively. “I must have offended them somehow, so they thought they would give me some special treatment. I just wasn’t in the mood.”
Casey eyed Monson suspiciously; he was clearly skeptical of Monson’s account. 
Monson stopped and took a step closer to Casey|As the old saying says:
“If you make people think they’re thinking,
they’ll love you;
But if you really make them think,
they’ll hate you.”
I was making myself really think and hating it. In fact, I hated that
saying, and hated it when our RMPE teacher made us copy it.  He was
always trying to get us to think. Why couldn’t he be just like everyone
else?
But I had an answer for the RMPE teacher|"I may be a bit of a science geek," Anna continued, "but has anyone noticed that no women have been reported to be infected?"

Her comment caused a lot of eyebrows to be raised. Not mine, of course, as I was doing all I could to remain sane. Carla was the first to respond, "Wow," said Carla. "Nice catch. What are your thoughts about this, Anna|The elevator doors slid open and she stepped into an office complex lavishly decorated in mauves and grays. The names of the law firm partners were elegantly sprawled in large gold letters across one fabric-covered wall.

Hannah had been inside this complex a number of times and knew it to be one of the most prestigious law firms in Manhattan. She'd had no idea Joshua was a part of this firm|The memory bothered me, but I felt as if the one person who should be answering them for me was nowhere in sight. Vivienne... Why on earth did you dump all these memories into my head? I can't make head or tail out of them.

"Earth to Sofia Claremont." Paige began waving her hand in front of my face. "Are you still with us, Sofia|Mrs. Cooper came over with a recipe, Sam trailing behind her.

"Girls, since most of your table is absent, Sam will be joining you today."

A little thrill went through me.

"Since he's new he doesn't have a group yet." She turned to Sam and handed him the recipe|"So you're here because you feel sorry for me? Because if that's the case, you can save your sympathy. I don't want pity. It's why I don't talk about-"

"Hey there..." He gently tugged on the strand of hair. "I do feel sorry for you, but it's not pity|Even though he tried to whisper Baxter’s voice still rang shrilly, echoing hollowly into the silence of the abandoned hallway and he cursed himself for the trepidation that threaded through it. “He’s here.”
Pausing in the act of throwing his cards on the table Leo looked up, his features drawn tight in a grimace of fear.  He knew what Raine could do; he’d been tutored.  Vince and Baxter had filled him in on all the details and the boy was scared|He walked right up to Myka, stopping maybe an inch from her, never mind about personal space.

Was it getting hard to breathe? No, Myka stood in the cool, fresh air, October in Austin dry and fine.

Jordan squirmed in her arms and pointed at Spike. "That's my dad." He said it proudly, no fear. "Did you know I had a dad|“Still, I figured a few wrong math statements would really tick you off . . . and it worked!” Gisbo smiled to himself.
“No, the fact that you were being stupid in a desperate situation ticked me off. Then the whole punching me in the face! You’re lucky, I’m telling you that right now,” Rolce stated, pointing at Gisbo|Right now they were still far from civilization.  He needed to save his concerns for more important things, like those things below them in the maze.  
He stopped suddenly and listened.  
“What’s wrong?”
He didn’t want to say what was wrong.  He hoped he was mistaken.  He hurried to the side of the bridge and shined his flashlight down onto the maze|"White hair means you're going to die, Grandpa."

Seldon looked shocked. He said to Manella, "What is all this?"

"I don't know, Hari. It's her own idea."

"I had a bad dream," said Wanda.

Seldon cleared his throat. "We all have bad dreams now and then, Wanda|He had, Alexia discovered much to her distress, unanticipated powers of resistance.

She slid her gun out from between them and pushed it away along the bench. Time enough to tell her husband about Lord Ambrose later. If she told him now, he'd get all flustered and distracted. At the moment, she preferred to be the cause of both his flustering and his distraction|“Too late, you had your pick, and you went for the nerdy professor,” said McKenzie.
Ana didn’t want to discuss what happened between Vo and her, so she said, “Have a safe trip home. And keep those thugs locked up forever.”
“We’ll do our best,” said McKenzie|I loved Tristan like a brother and I hated that he felt disappointed. He was used to human girls, raised to be gentlemanly. And I hadn’t lied to him, even if I had an arsenal of super-human abilities, it was still nice to be treated like a lady.
	Tristan held my gaze for a moment longer before exhaling a sigh that told me I was forgiven|He'd sit down and explain the situation and help her find a place she'd be comfortable living in. Maybe Reverend Halpern could help. Surely he'd had people in his congregation with similar issues.

Luke went into the office and sat at the computer to update the books. The cramped room was situated on the first floor of their parents' house, since Lisa used to do this job before she handed it over to Luke|She noticed that he had stopped laughing and now seemed to be admiring her.

“What’s wrong?” she asked, wiping a joyful tear from her eye.

“Promise you won’t think I’m weird?” he asked.

Jennifer suddenly became serious.

“Ewen, I would never think you’re weird|“Nurse, as in nursing a baby with mother’s milk, has a female gender, but to nurse as in sickness, has no gender at all.
“Language is a window into the culture. Any language is able to express those nuances that the culture considers important and ignores those that it does not. Look how they use the same word for smile and grimace. The smile is the female form of the male grimace|"Do you regret that?" asked Manjy.
"Not at all. There was nothing else to do."
"The rings were evil and commissioned from the very start with an evil intent. They could only have been used for evil purposes," Alan observed.
"I'm glad you see it that way," said Manjy|Shopping, eating out, concerts, a tennis match and even at a bar. I never stood in her way, never tried to “trap” or corner her in any way, always leaving her a way out and letting her withdraw at will. And I went nowhere near her home or office. I didn’t want her thinking I was a stalker|The slightest hint of a tear came into his eye.
“We have no more time, dear Truman.”
“Is there nothing to do?”
“There is one thing left that I can think of.”
I stared at him for a moment.
“No.” I said.
“It is I who they want, Truman|But when they all filed into the circle and sat down knee to knee as Diana instructed, any interest in the actual ceremony flew right out of her mind.

She had ended up between Faye and Adam. She didn't know how it had happened. She had been in line to sit next to Sean, but somehow Faye had gotten in front of her. Maybe Faye didn't want to sit by Adam|She was a lonely woman, a bit lost and insecure, and yet, she was so smart, so scrappy, so incredibly sweet when she wanted to be.

"Skipper's been trying to steal him away from me," Piper said in her Barbie voice-over.

"A good man can't be stolen|"I'm just calling to say that I'm sorry about the whole Lottie thing. I should have figured it out sooner, but Zack never mentioned her last name."

"It's okay. It's not your fault."

"This is going to make things weirder. I mean, weirder than they already are."

I couldn't deny it, because things were going to be weird|Whatever the reason, Amanda was the only person Piper was willing to stay with, and Danny had to figure out how exactly to ask an heiress to baby-sit his daughter.

"She must be on a break from working at the hair salon. You can run on over and say hi." Danny had told Piper they were coming to town so he could get a haircut. Which was true, he did need a little trim|Hopefully, from now on it will only get better.”
“I’d like to know what’s wrong with me,” said Dusty.
“We’ll give you a full briefing a bit later, don’t worry, although it will be difficult to know where to start.”
“I can’t feel much of my leg,” said Dusty|I am impressed with your initiative. It kind of reminds me of a very short story.” Marie smiled. “Would you like to hear it?” she asked. Amber nodded.
“Four people were sitting on a beach bench, and one decided to take a swim. How many people were left on the beach bench|Her eyes were fixed unwaveringly on Jack, as if a glance aside would break her power over him.

Damon fumbled open the briefcase at her feet, unlatching the box he found inside. Five needles full of the poison, each shimmering softly in the light of the moon overhead. He grabbed one, unclipping it from the side of the box, and held it tightly but carefully as he turned back toward Jack|Then turning to Jones, “And your firm, your juror experts, what will they give us?”
“Selection criteria. The questions to ask,” said Jones.
Simmons did not respond. But made a note of it. Then asked, “How many peremptory challenges will we have. Any idea?”
“My guess is between ten and sixteen. It’s up to the judge,” said Jones|She shook her head.  "Poor Rod.  I miss him so much."
Colleen nodded.  Her uncle had left a bigger gap in her life than she ever would have expected.
"It's over, I guess," said Jane.  "This whole nightmare."
"I guess it is," said Colleen|Apparently, all they eat is pizza.  So, I thought it would be nice of us to invite them over for dinner.”
“I’m sorry for them.  But Dad, when was the last time we had a home cooked meal?  That’s not our thing either.”
“I only promised them a good meal that wasn’t pizza|He finally managed to get her a pair of earrings while she was buying everybody socks.

That evening, when Mrs. Cormaci came by with an armload of presents for them, Gregor answered the door.

"So, you're finally up and around, Mister," she said.

At first Gregor didn't know what she was talking about; then he remembered he was supposed to have had the flu|I tucked the phone into my pocket and looked back at the boaters. They were far out now but I could still hear their laughter. Maybe tonight I would try and capture some of that. I never thought that I would get the chance to go on a date with her. I felt a little guilty because I had to lie to get the date|"It's not a breakfast cereal, Miss Meechum. Not a breakfast cereal." I disconnect the call before she can respond.

Jennifer steps through the French doors with a smile on her face and a few flowers in her hand. "Who was that?" She moves to the kitchen to get a vase|She had felt that the sympathy in their gazes had mocked her and afterward she had known that despite everything else, that trip had been the hardest thing she’d ever had to do in her life.
The visitors that she had been dreading showed up four days after Raine had disappeared.  There was a knock on the door as she was feeding the girls their lunch.  She turned sharply at the sound, wild hope hammering in her chest before she realized that Raine wouldn’t have knocked|"You wouldn't miss me," she sniffled.

"Nah, you're probably right. I only miss you a little now. When I'm awake. When I'm asleep. When I'm breathing." When Miracle finally met his gaze, Hardy let his heart pour into his eyes. "My life is nothing without you, Miracle|I made sure he created the serum, based on instructions I was given. The only thing is, in order for it to work, The Hunters have to be activated. That's why I lead Drake to do so. Form The Vipers, activate The Hunters, set the plan in motion. I plan to use the serum on all the Hunters|She stood stock-still in the middle of the trail, unconsciously holding her breath, wondering what she had heard, and wondering if indeed she had heard anything. The silence seemed absolute. Not a squirrel chattered or bird chirped. Then her gaze fixed itself on a mass of bushes beside the trail a few yards ahead of her. There was no breeze, yet she had seen a branch quiver. The short hairs on her scalp prickled, and she stood for an instant undecided, certain that a move in either direction would bring death streaking at her from the bushes|“I’m worried about you. You don’t know what you’re getting into,” he said, then continued, “What you’re about to get into is different. It’s not about wrestling. It’s about politics. Remember I said that.”
“What do you mean it’s not about wrestling|Everyone greeted each other with excitement. Faolan grabbed Orin up in a big hug, and then welcomed them to journey with their company back to the village. 
“It seems I was wrong,” Faolan said, walking over to Ava. “We paid dearly for our ignorance.” 
She saw respect but also a vestige of old pain and fear in his eyes before he turned back to Orin|“Let go,” he stated, no hesitation in his voice. “Trust me.”
Kay’s heart stopped. She felt the hammering of the thunderstorm, felt the soft heaving of the injured foal’s body, and yet all that existed was Reese and her.
He had lost a hold on his sanity. There was no way he could catch her and the foal|“Completely different one. An invisible one, if you get my drift.”
Grigor chuckled. “You know, those same Columbians lost a peacock they were smuggling a few months back.”
“Weird.”
“Yup, really weird.” Grigor leaned in the window. “It would be a shame if they found out who kept stealing the animals they were trying to smuggle|A corner of turmoil engaged a group of polypeptide chains m the heart of the cell.

'Reduce it,' Potter said.

Svengaard touched the NADH feeder key. He couldn't see what Potter saw, but the surgeon's forehead lens reproduced a slightly off-parallax view of the scope field. That plus Potter's instructions told of the slow spread of change in the cell|"Matilda," she said, simply, "you have a noble heart! No one else has ever asked me that, though they tried to cure it. And I couldn't answer till I was asked, could I? It is a sad, a tragic tale. Matilda, I was once as fat as you are."

"I'm not so very fat," said Matilda|My grandfather lived there as a boy and he left it to me, only it's been a lot of years since anyone's cared for that old house properly and there's plenty of work that needs to be done."

"I'll work for you," Jeff piped up eagerly. He made a fist and flexed his arm, revealing the meager muscles. "I know it doesn't look like much, but I'm strong|This was how it went, day after day, as the snow fell and filled the clearing, rising up around the hut in great white waves.

On the morning the snow finally stopped, the witch fed Nadya potato pie and sausages and asked her, "What is it you want?"

"I want to go home," said Nadya|Donovan stood there staring at our linked fingers for a moment, that tight expression still on his face, before he shook his head. "What are the four of you doing here? And don't tell me that you came just to get brunch."

"Callie is my best friend," Bria said in a quiet voice. "We're here to help her, Donovan|As Felicity opened her mouth to answer, the woman’s attention was suddenly diverted. “Callum Johnson! Get off that piano!”
Felicity turned to see a boy of about fourteen or fifteen sitting on top of an old and rather dilapidated grand piano in the reception area, laughing with his friends. “But Miss, I’ve always wanted to learn piano|When night falls," he said solemnly, his mouth lowering toward hers.

"But-" Jo turned her head away. "Nicholas, this is important. We really have to-"

"You're important," Nicholas interrupted quietly, catching her face and turning her to peer at him. "You're the most important thing in the world to me, Jo|If it’s gold leaf over wood it’ll sound just like wood. If it’s solid gold, it should give a thunk.”
Mr. Tolley got Freddie into position.  Freddie put his ear against the steeple and tapped.  Down on the ground we held our breath.
“I think it thunked,” said Freddie|I asked Max and he told me who she was and then I’d seen her name on the auction list. We’d been doing the auction for five years and I’d never bid before. It didn’t seem like the sort of thing a CEO should do. That night I went there on impulse, and even more impulsively I began to bid|I saw the way I stayed in the shadows, not fighting against my teacher's grasp. Weak. I felt weak.

And so I pulled away.

"Cammie, come here," Bex's mom ordered again. I could see Bex behind her, not moving. Dazed. "Cammie!" Bex's mom snapped, but I looked at my teacher|Toby?" I didn't bother to keep the disbelief out of my voice. I definitely wouldn't have used that word to describe him.

The passenger laughed. "What, he wasn't romantic enough for you? Is that why you dumped him?"

"You don't know anything about my relationship with Toby|I'm sure Princess Ashton won't mind slumming it at Hank's. The burgers there are better than anything the Seafood Shack has and she really needs to taste their sweet tea."

Sawyer frowned a moment then nodded. "Okay, Ash's agreeable. I'm sure she'll be fine with Hank's. I've taken her there a couple times but I think she might agree with you on the burgers|If we have enough money," she added with a sigh.

"You'll have enough money," Mia said. "I bet this year you'll get a ton of guests. Your website looks great." She dug her finger under the flap of the envelope and began to open it.

"That's what I love about you, Mia|“There has to be an explanation. Did you interview for the job in person?”
“I didn’t even meet Roxy until my first day of work,” Max says. “Let’s say she didn’t realize who I was before she hired me. Wouldn’t she have told me when I got here there’d been a mistake and there was no job|Chuck rubbed his hands together briskly and stepped aside. "A gift! We get a gift!" he called over his shoulder. "Come in, come in!"
Mother entered and tried not to feel uncomfortable. Chuck was odd, there was no question. And anyone who did the clean out work day in and day out would also be odd|I had a very small checking account when we got married. He had ... more."

"How do you like living in Cambridge?" Paul changed the subject, far from eager to learn how much more the Professor had.

"I love it. We live close enough to Harvard so I can walk. Which is good, because I don't drive|“I don’t suppose you could be persuaded to join me at the café.”
Setzer straightened, pushing away from the wall with a continual smirk. “Only if you play a game of cards.”
“Ah. It’s been ages. Of course I will.” And they made their way to the café. “Thank you for bringing the children, Setzer|Elena rol ed over and buried her face in the pil ow. She knew the truth now. No matter what the Guardians had done for her, she would never be a normal girl. Her life would never be simple. Tragedy and horror would fol ow her forever.

"Cookies," Alaric said gravely. "Bonnie thinks she could manage to choke down a few cookies|I'm going to make friends with this girl."

But Anna shook her head. "Just send her to me. She'll trust me more, the sweet old lady."

"Good point."

Not that there was anything sweet about Anna. Or herself.

"You're as devious as ever, Anna|I don't where to start."

"I'll help you. We'll find him."

"How?" he asked, sounding desperate.

"Logan said they were on the way to a friend of the family's house. That was why they were in Virginia. Did she have any friends who lived in Virginia|And, I picked up my Pulaski axe and got ready.
I was pretty sure that even at these temperatures it would not burn through the cable.  But, I hoped the heat would weaken the cable just enough.  As the sparklers burned, I saw the cable getting red.
‘Aye Yow,” I yelled!  
In one quick motion I brought the sharpened steel axe blade down on the cable|Maintaining the lie, even though I'm trying to convince myself it's for good reason-to help him, to help Tia-still feels ... wretched.

"Well, if my opinion matters, I don't see you as weak either. I think you're probably one of the strongest people I've ever known. I guess that's why I don't want you thinking that I'm weak|The pilot was going on instruments and moonlight and sheer force of will as the small plane touched down on the snow-covered ice, gliding on skis toward us.

Zach turned to the group. "Let's go."

We hunched low and ran across the ice. Liz slid and fell, and Macey reached for her, half-carried her toward the plane|She wanted to tell him that, but her throat was closed tight-too tight to speak, too tight to breathe.

The thing lifted the glowing rod and pointed it toward Helen.

"No!" shouted Drake. Somewhere, he found the strength to jump to his feet and lunge at the thing. His sword sliced high, taking off the arm that held the rod|"My wife's name is Elizabeth."

Flannery said nothing.

"You remember her, don't you?"

Again he flipped a glance at Tyrese.

"Was she a client, Mr. Flannery?"

He cleared his throat. "No," he said. "No, she wasn't a client|"I can't do it, Marina," Hector says, stopping before his feet reach the water.

I drop my Chest and grab his arm and say, "I can fix you, Hector. You can make it."

"It wouldn't make any difference. I don't know how to swim."

"I'm Marina of the sea, Hector|The fire should have lasted much longer. His powers must be weaker than he'd realized.

"Fire flew out of your mouth." Grace gaped. "Fire really and truly flew out of your mouth."

"Yes."

"But fire flew out of your mouth."

"I did tell you I was a dragon|Lucky lifted her chin defiantly. "Sure, why not?"

Mike stepped closer but resumed the same challenging stance. "You were never going to Washington in the first place, were you?"

Letting her breath seep out between her teeth, she leaned against the lintel. "What do you want from me, Mike|Pandar and Centauran were closer, but he didn't know Jonah or Sceron as well as he knew Khardeen, and he didn't know if the satyr or centaur Healers could deal with this poison.

Besides, Jaenelle would most likely head for Scelt. And that decided him.

"I'm getting you out of here," he said as he started to lift her. Then he realized her hand was still clamped around the bladed stick. "Sweetheart, let go of the stick|I steeled myself as I stepped out of the car.

I saw no one in the cemetery. Gripping my jacket near the collar to pull it tighter, I walked with my head down; I didn't have to watch where I was going. The ground was wet, clinging to my feet. In a minute, I was at the grave|When he put his mouth on her, Cadence's body arched. He locked a hand around her hips, stilling her and forcing her closer to his mouth.

He'd thought her mouth was heaven. Her sex-yes. Even better. Even. Better.

He licked and wanted more. She was gasping now, pushing her hips against him, and he wasn't stopping|But Christian, like any lovesick guy, didn't listen. He picked up a branch as well and swung it at one of the hounds. Flames burst from the wood. The hound backed up, still compelled to follow Victor's orders, though also clearly afraid of the fire.

Its companion, the fourth hound, circled away from the torch and came up behind Christian|Egypt is not only wealthy, and already well-administered, but easily defended."
"You are very discerning, Phidias. Those were my reasonings exactly."
"When will you leave Babylon for Egypt?"
"As soon as possible. My men are collecting supplies and what treasure that Perdiccas will allow us."
"I wish to go with you," said Phidias|`As soon as we get back to civilization she'll learn what he has been saying.  Everything will come out then.'

`It might be best if she learns later, because we won't be crowded together on a raft then,' said Amanda.

`There's that angle of course.'

`It's our secret then,' said Amanda|Nadia sailed off with the sublimely confident air of a queen about to inspect her domain and order improvements on it in the very near future.

'She'll try to take over,' Nick muttered in warning.

'A bit of giving won't hurt.' Tess raised an eloquently knowing gaze to his. 'She needs us in her life, Nick|Yegor was mulling in depression and Chad was too afraid to speak. I had to do something to break the ice. I confronted the issue head on. It was all I knew.
“Do you know why they only picked you Chad?” I asked. Chad’s eyes fearfully cut at me in the front seat. He didn’t want to discuss this in front of Yegor|She was mad about the cake. 
"Ooh." Tracy smiled and hit Shari playfully on the shoulder. "My little sister is going to be a hottie."
"Tracy, don't talk like that," her mother said. She looked over at Shari. "You're too young to be a hottie|For a moment, she stared at the ice cubes and shards of green glass scattered in the puddle on the floor, and then she gasped.

She was in labor. The baby was coming.

Upstairs, Vince turned off the shower. Though he had never mentioned it to Cara, he grew more nervous about the baby with each passing day. Sometimes he wished he could hypnotize himself the way he had Cara|“No such luck here,” said Gabriel.
“No,” said Flannery. “No such luck here.”
“I don’t think we can rule that out though.”
“What?”
“That the mirrors may be involved, with the blanket, somehow,” said Gabriel.
“Of course they are involved, but not with the blanket|She shuffled toward him, the brightness growing around her as she neared the light.

Cadence didn't move.

"You said she'd take my place," Fiona mumbled, rubbing her arms. "Can I go? I want to go."

"Not yet. You have to do one more thing first|Outside, the storm had passed, leaving only the sound of water dripping from the roof edges and the ever-present wind rattling the shingles.

"He's staying in one of the trailers, you know."

"What?" Startled, Maura looked her sister in the eye.

"I said, Jefferson is staying in one of the trailers|A little more... just a little more... don't be distracted... don't look toward the horizon or you'll never get back on track... you're almost there... almost...
Moments later Sophie threw her arms around Gracie's neck and clung to her as if she'd never let her go.
"Don't leave me here," Sophie cried. "Don't let go!"
"Don't worry," Gracie promised as the current swirled around them. "You're safe with me now, Sophie|David froze halfway to the door, torn between two responses: shock and dismay over the affair, and the realization that this information probably shouldn't be coming from Skye.

Concern over Skye's involvement won out. "And how would you know something so personal about Jane Burke?"

"I saw them together."

"Where?"

She didn't answer right away.

"I just asked you a question, Skye|Sinclair slid his arm along the back of the sofa and she turned her head toward him. Close. So close.
She said softly, “There is a certain type of gentleman who, if he accidentally stripped a maiden of her respectability, would run posthaste to her father to rectify the situation. I don’t doubt you are that kind of gentleman|With his gun on his shoulder, he travels deeper in the forest. He has seen a few turkey, but nothing in range of his sights. These woods are full of hills giving way to large valleys. He senses something in the atmosphere here that is different from any woods he's been in. Not quite placing this emotion, he takes one step, stops, and then listens|She hesitantly brings up the subject. Small talk starts then the conversation changes to in depth dialogue. Slowly the wheel turns. When the cogs stop the arrow always points to love.”
Amber giggled. She was still shaking her head when Craig came sprinting up behind the pair.
“You forgot to give me a single hint on how to love a woman,” exclaimed Craig|Josh changed the setting of the shield to repel instead of absorbing energy.  Suddenly, the animals were rubbing against the shield.  They made sounds that vibrated through the ships when they touched the shield.
Josh said, "Sounds like their version of a purr.  Biggest, scariest cats I've ever seen or hope to see."
Lemmy asked, "What are you going to do now, Josh|"She's blackmailing me, Jake."

His expression turned livid. "What?!" He demanded furiously. "Explain. Now." His tone was clipped as he made an obvious effort to reign in his anger. But his hands on either side of her had balled into fists.

"She has a tape of us, Jake|The minister paled slightly but then smiled as he glanced back and forth between us.

"No pictures?" I asked, turning towards Jack. "Not even one, just for us?"

Jack frowned for a moment, then lowered his hand and reached in his pocket. "No pictures except this one. This one is for us," he said as he pulled out his phone and handed it to the minister|She wasn’t moving, her chest still. 
Tears streaked down my face. “You can’t die,” I sobbed. “No one dies in Awkward.”
Elspeth was screaming from the edge of the swamp, mud climbing the hem of her dress as she moved into the water. I waved her away, my boots digging into the mud as I pulled Nimble free of the swamp|She tried the small key and gasped when gears suddenly began to turn and the whole armoire whirred. Her mind racing, she slammed the door in fright.
What is this thing?
She put her ear to the wood and listened. The armoire was now ticking like a grandfather clock. Curiosity getting the better of her, she cautiously looked inside and saw a strange door at the back of the armoire|We've been waiting for you."

Were Aunt Millie and her friends up to their old matchmaking tricks? Surely not while Delaney was pregnant! Aunt Millie had once mentioned wanting to introduce her to Preston Willigut, her piano tuner. Maybe they'd invited him to come for dinner. But the only pair of young eyes that looked up when she entered the room didn't belong to Preston|“When are you going to come up with new material?  I’ve heard that one at least ten times.”
Kayla quipped back, “I have to repeat everything ten times, because I’m worried that you’re too stupid to comprehend what I am saying the first nine times.”
Bryn sighed and said, “Whatever, Kayla|Lights left on by the work crew cast a pale glow across the dirt ground while the white canvas skins of the tents flap noiselessly in the cool, ocean breeze. From further on, through the pitch blackness, I can hear the sound of gulls and the rhythmic lull of waves.
Josh shivers. “This is creepy.”
“My thoughts exactly,” I say, leaning my bike up against one of the tents|But Gregor had heard her barking orders in combat. Solovet's ability to swing between gracious lady and soldier unnerved him because he never knew which one to expect. She sounded more like the soldier now.

Gregor didn't want to eavesdrop, so he turned to slip away. But then he heard his name and couldn't help listening|* * *

He watched the Old Sheriff’s car roll off the road into the tree and he was sad for him. He told the moose that it could go now and it wandered slowly, in that wonderful way those majestic creatures did, off into the forest. He smiled for a moment because he sacrificed something wonderful for the sake of the town. The town would mourn the loss of the Old Sheriff|"Oh, and I put the take-out in the fridge for later, if that's okay."

The only thing he was hungry for was sitting next to him. "Fine by me."

"Thanks for bringing dinner."

"Figured we were in for a long night, though I like the idea of going out someplace. But only if you agree upfront that I'm paying|Mathews lifted a dark brow. "Are you sure about that? I mean, wouldn't it be better to wait until Dale is home safe and sound?"

"The longer I wait to tell her, the worse it will be for both of us."

"Good luck. You're going to need it," said Mathews|Thankfully, the principal had given her the day off to take care of the arrangements. All she had to do was drop off her lesson plan for the sub.

She'd just gotten dressed and walked into the kitchen when the phone rang. She answered it, and Detective Mathews's deep voice filled the line. Without preamble, he said, "We have a suspect|He said nothing.

She grabbed a remote control from the table. A flat-screen monitor resting on the corner of the desk sprang to life with the image of five men milling among a crowd, examining stalls beneath bright awnings burgeoning with fresh produce.

Her guest rose to his feet.

"This surveillance video came from one of the cameras in the Navoi market|I have heard that you can’t run from your problems but by creating new problems you can forget about your old ones.  Here every day is a new problem, food, water, bugs… 
After it is all translated back he takes a small rug from behind him and sets it between us.  He hands me some bones and I am told to scatter them on the rug|The smell of the coffee vanquished the remnants of fear and bewilderment in her; she felt capable again and not so intimidated.

Corning said, 'We have a permanent photographic sequence of your evening at 45 Avila Street. From the moment you followed Bruce Himmel up the stairs and inside. Your initial words were, "Hello, Bruce|She kept picturing Mike kissing Lindsey Carpenter in the barn and thinking that tonight it could have been her.

After growing up with Red, she'd decided that it was important to save herself. But for what? For more offers from strange men who didn't appeal to her? Was she a fool not to take advantage of the opportunity to be with Mike|Andy began recounting the details of their trip, trying not to leave anything out. As he got to the part where he and Alden had seen vulture-men on the Great Wall, there came a loud, rapid knocking on the door.
“Enter,” instructed the King.
Alden threw open the door and rushed in. “Sorry to interrupt, sir,” he said, looking at the King|The nametag on his chest read Andrew Pine.  Some people just have the perfect name for the job.  Is someone named Pine simply destined to be a forest ranger?  Probably.  It reminded me of a police officer in Cincinnati.  His name was Jonathan Leash.  He was head of the canine unit.  There was no more suitable place for him in the department|After getting dressed and adding the expensive watch that Luccio had ‘loaned’ him, he checked himself out in the mirror. He would do.
Emptying the rest of his stuff out of the bag that hadn’t left his side since he’d boarded the flight in L.A., he lifted up the removable bottom. One hundred thousand dollars in neatly stacked bills sat there, courtesy of Luccio|They've shot them both down. You're deep in their firing range."

"I do not want to hear how many times you've failed, Captain. Send a topographic map to my phone with an overlay of their firing radius."

"Yes, sir. We think Ceuta may be sending ground troops to your location-"

Dorian held the phone out and studied the map, ignoring the captain|“Dead serious.  How does a breaded tenderloin sandwich with mayo, tomato and lettuce sound?”
“It sounds good, but I don’t think I should leave the house.”
“Steak fries?”
“We really shouldn’t be seen together.”
“How about fried green tomatoes instead of the fries|She told her Derek’s suspicion that her phone may be bugged and said she would not be calling her again for a while.
“Amber, do you think that is wise.  Derek can protect you,” Olivia said.
“I thought so too, Livy, but look what happened.  Anyone is vulnerable as long as we don’t know who this guy is,” replied Amber|It was half full of split wood.  “Can I bring in more wood for you?”
“Yes, but you don’t have to go far.”
She walked over to the barred back door and unlocked it.  
“I keep this door boarded up, just in case.  But right here in the back porch, is where I keep a lot of my wood|Dave refused to let the approaching evil be his last sight on earth. He closed his eyes and brought Torie’s face to mind. He studied the soft blue-gray eyes; he thought of her long auburn hair and her bangs falling slowly over her forehead, while she brushed them back. He remembered her beautiful smile and full lips that he would never taste again, and he said quietly, out loud, as the gravel crunched beneath Horn-Rims’ feet and he stepped to within point-blank range, “I love you, Torie|They would have to get Trunk far enough away from the spiders to calm the giant creature down.  Unfortunately Trunk was standing near the opening of the tunnel leading back towards the prison and the rapidly growing population of tunnel spiders stood between him and the opening leading outside.  
Roulibard had been shocked by Trunk’s reaction to the tunnel spiders|Anyone seeing them would think he was a merman and she was a mermaid.
“Xanthus?” 
“Yes, Mou?”
“What happened to the mermaids?”
“Why do you ask?” he asked, as if the question surprised him.
“I’m just curious. I’ve always wondered if I might be a mermaid|It was too late, however. The Guard had been sent out to arrest the Markiz. He would be tried before the court of the Rada for treachery. Jarvis was furious, and left little doubt in my mind that the Markiz would be dismissed from the Rada and imprisoned.

I received a letter from Kir, asking after me, confirming the rumours in Vasterya, the worry in Pharya over the Markiz' arrest|I feel better now that I'm armed. Was there any other ammunition?”
“Sorry, that's all I managed to acquire. I didn't even check how many rounds were in it, just that it was loaded.”
“Thank you anyhow. I feel much more useful now that I'm armed|“You know the drill; press the trigger to shunt your electricity into the other.” He pushed the button; Sarah jerked her trigger, sending a double jolt into me. I refused to play his game. Again, he cranked up the volume and shocked me again. Sarah was crying but wouldn’t let go of the trigger|She leaned over to Felicity. “Oh em gee,” she whispered. “He’s an absolute dream, don’t you think?”
Felicity looked at Oliver. His skin was quite pale, his dark hair hung around his face, and his eyes were brown. Beyond that, she couldn’t really see much, and had no idea what qualified as a ‘dream|He raised his eyes up to Michael, whose face had crumbled into something between anguish and disbelief. My limbs were shaking badly, but I still reached up and touched the side of his cheek to make him look me in the eye. The strange metaphysical energy of his poltergeist form spilled across my tired skin and gave me enough power to speak clearly. 
“This is what you were born to do, Michael|“A turtle on the brink of death would’ve already gotten there,” stated Mrs. Loya, shaking her head.
“I’m pre. . .”
“You’re what?” asked Mr. Loya.
“I’m pregnant,” Valeria blurted.
“Pregnant with a child?” asked Mrs. Loya, her tone scratchy.
“No, I’m pregnant with a goat,” said Valeria|“Well if you want I could slap you and storm off.”
“Um no. I'd rather not have to explain a black eye. Or that a girl did it.”
Smiling, Indie shrugged. “Okay, then we're good.”
“Yeah.” 
Indie turned, heading for the exit. 
Before she'd gone two steps he called, “Hey Indie|What had gone on between those two women in the car, and in the vineyards, and in the hotels?  Who was this woman, The Deneuve?  What was it about her that was so compelling, not only to men (that was easy to understand….the world’s greatest beauty) but also to women|She never married, never really had time to date. She's ambitious. She's incredibly ambitious.

I see Kendra sitting in a large office, phone in one hand, file in the other. She's a hotshot defense attorney, but that means putting in lots of hours. But she's willing to do it-because she wants to make partner|Knowing it was his second to last term, Pip had arrived early, his family callously discarded with minimum fuss at Paddington station where Pip took himself unaccompanied by train all the way to Penzance.  He was one of the first to be greeted by Mr Barnes, dropped off early in the afternoon by Mr Wallace who had met him at Penzance station.
“Hello, sir, still here then?” was the greeting Pip gave Mr Barnes.
“I have not yet expired nor been sent down in disgrace despite cheek from boys like you, Pip|"Believe me, Yugo, I never go to bed at night without that particular thought gnawing at me. Still, we haven't come to it yet. All we have is this-which, as you say, is no more than seeing light and dark fuzzily through frosted glass."

"True enough."

"And what is it you think you see, Yugo|I tried to climb in to ascertain if it really was the same place-one second on that bowed floor and I would know it for certain-but I could not get any farther than the opening. It, too, was crammed full of boxes.

Stymied, I explored with my hands, moving back out into the hall. I found I could go no deeper down the passageway; it was entirely filled with the mysterious cardboard squares.

As I hunted along the floor, trying to understand, I found something different from the crowd of boxes|She is floating against the far wall, with her head almost touching the ceiling and her feet dangling down on thin air. Her arms are outstretched so that her hands are on a level with her hips a posture that does not quite mimic crucifixion but at least suggests it. In each fisted hand, JOANNA holds a LIGHTED CANDLE. The melting wax has run

STORM OF THE CENTURY 307

down over her fingers|As the trailer passed I stepped blindly back out into the road and immediately heard the screech of tires on the asphalt. A blue four-wheel drive pick-up came to a stop, and I instinctively jumped back between the cars. The truck looked like the one that Max and I rode in when we hitched a ride down from the Parkway. Looking through the window at the back glass I didn’t see any stickers, so I assumed it was a different truck|Captain Varner has been, as you know, under my care for twenty-three years. I've heard his story hundreds of times, and I doubt there is a detail of which I am not as conversant as he. I would venture that I am more conversant, given the deterioration of his faculties."

Warthrop said, "I wish to hear it from the captain|He not only acted like he owned the place, he acted like he and Roger and Gwen were the only people in the joint.  He walked straight up to their table, stopped, looked at Roger, looked at Gwen, and said, “You heeled, Roger?”  This amazed Roger, who knew what it meant to be heeled|There was much to see…
She was gawking at the countryside and the ranch house when Dan came up behind and nudged her.
“Sorry, ma’am.  Did I bump into you?” he drawled.
“Yes, sir.  You did…” smiled Sarah.
“Let me take your bags in for you.”
“Thanks, Dan. I can do it…” He wouldn’t give up the bags|His cheeks were red, capillaries broken on the surface. "Please."

Then, as suddenly as he'd started, he freed my hands, letting them fall back into my lap. They stung, like hundreds of needles were poking at the surface, but what I felt inside hurt the worst.

I loved the broken man kneeling in front of me - loved him like I never would another|It was so wonderful, finally, to find a man who understood her appetite and approved of it.

THE NEXT FEW weeks went by in a delicious series of dates. At the end of three weeks, Henry said, "I love you, Lois. I want you to be my wife." Words she thought she would never hear. She put her arms around him and said, "I love you, too, Henry|His body arched and I watched him closing his eyes and fighting the urge to let go.

Brooks was never selfish. He flipped us over, teasing me with his tongue, and focusing on my mouth instead of the package between his legs. "Don't make me stop, Brooks. We have all night."

He corrected me, "No, Kat, we have forever|“You think he will be willing to fight for us if we have been holding him prisoner?”
Liyra was beginning to sound angry. “What do you suggest we do? We cannot let him go!”
“I don’t know. But I’m sure this kind of secrecy isn’t going to get us much further. We have to draw the line at some point, Liyra|Earlier, she had taken a hover train to reach this part of Noir.  Kat noticed a black van with dark tinted windows parked near Bes and panicked.  She needed to get a hold of her paranoia.  The Council and the Factory could no longer track her, so it was just a van.  No one was after her, and Kat nodded as if she convinced herself and moved to the front door, keeping an eye on the van|Alyssa eyes filled with tears at the sight of her grandmother, but the stranger with her made her hesitate.
She glanced at Gabe, who came around the truck and headed quickly to the porch. Reaching out to take Samantha’s hand Alyssa watched as Gabe strode boldly up the steps. To her surprise he stopped before Cora and offered her his hand saying, “Good evening Ma’am, my name is Gabe|Lissa clapped her hands. "That was just the phrase you used. 'Mountains of carbs!' "

The afternoon unspooled in a gust of wind and woolly scarves. Dashing out of the restaurant. Jumping on the subway to get to the IHOP over on Flatbush Avenue. "We were crazy; we must have each eaten for two," said Lissa|Our boss liked to have a bit of a break then with a holiday by the sea and we had a wonderful time frolicking up and down the beach with him. Then there was the arduous journey back to the station where we had to complete our jobs before the wet season set in. Once the wet season had set in it was a miserable place to be with water everywhere and continuously getting bogged. The humidity during this time caused all sorts of problems and the isolation had a big effect on some of the workers|Domenico's eyes closed. "You don't know," he whispered back, "you just don't know how much I had dreamt of you saying that, Misty." He opened his eyes, saw her crying silently, and slowly licked the tears away. He said fiercely against her skin, "I don't think love is enough to describe how I feel about you, Misty|She had her training wheels taken off her bike for the first time, and she was determined to ride her bike like her older siblings.
Her father let go of the bike while she was peddling as hard as she could. One second, two seconds, three seconds passed and bam. She ran into a parked car. The neighbor kids all ran over to her along with her father. He scooped her up in his arms and grabbed the bike|Just finish whatever it is you're trying to do and get home. I need you here. And I miss you, baby girl."

Her chest tightened. Lou had been a second father to her. Moving to Knoxville on the heels of her father's death was almost like losing both of them. "I miss you, too, Lou|They wanted to know where we were going, where we came from, why were there so many of us in the van, and so on. They didn’t seem to believe that we were just sightseeing. 
They searched the van for about ten minutes, going back and forth from the front to the back several times. They appeared to be certain that drugs were somewhere to be found in the van|“It’s a beautiful kind, whatever it is.”
Vo smiled, and put the pearl away. He turned to look at Ana. “Do you want to come out here again with me?” 
“Just the two of us?” 
Vo nodded. 
“People may get the wrong ideas,” said Ana|After Heather left, she was going to tell Jeff the truth. She fully intended to let him have his dog, but he'd have to wait a while. She'd been practicing what to say. She'd even come up with a compromise. They could get a cat. Cats didn't seem to mind being left on their own, and they didn't need to be walked|“All right,” she said quickly, starting to rise. “Let’s go. I think I—”
“Not me,” said Kendril. “You.”
Jade stared at him. “I can’t leave you here. You’ll die.”
His face flinched with pain. “I’ve got a crossbow bolt in my side, Jade|Alec watched cautiously as he noticed the spark in her eyes he hadn’t seen before. She was excited, a true warrior who wanted to reclaim her independence. 
“Do you want some help? That first step can be hard,” he offered.
 She shook her head no. “I have to do this for myself, Alec|“I wish I had a sister, doesn’t have to be a twin, just any old sister.”  
“That’s stupid!” shouted Bryan. “Stupid, stupid, stupid!” 
Joel stared at him in his dream, stared at his twin and loved that his twin was a mirror of himself.  It was special and wonderful and magical to have a twin|"You won't need me for this, will you?" Lesley asked hopefully.

"Women are afraid of guts," Eric explained for Chase's benefit.

"Is that so?"

"They go all weird over that kind of stuff. Mom's the same way. One time, the neighbor's cat, a black one named Midnight...you know Midnight, don't you, Lesley|"Do you have any idea how cool this is, Connor? I can call you Connor, right?"

Connor looks down and sees that the wound on his chest has been redressed with actual gauze and surgical tape. The fact that he can see the bandage brings to his attention the fact that he's shirtless.

"What did you do with my shirt|She chewed on her lip, indecision weighing her down until she finally gave up. "I know it's raining, but we should take my bike instead of your truck. Glad you brought this." She zipped up the gray rain jacket he'd had in his vehicle.

A frisson of worry fingered up his spine at the idea of her exposed on the Gixxer, and he wasn't thinking about rain|All they knew for certain was the space lanes around here appeared almost empty.  They saw a few ion trails but no actual spaceships.
Cherry moved Josh back to his quarters so he would be more comfortable and closer to the galley.  Afterwards, he left to do a thorough damage assessment.  When he finished, he came back to get Josh to take him to the galley|Decker stepped out of the trees and crossed to the fire to drop the burning log he'd been using as a torch to search the woods while Justin changed the tire on the van. He hadn't found a thing. It seemed the fifth rogue from the clearing had gotten away too.

He glanced over the remaining rogues. They lay where they'd fallen, trussed up with some rope Justin had found in the van|And what I'd just seen-I wasn't supposed to. If Collin had noticed, he wouldn't be concerned about me. For some reason, I was the only one who saw. And Eric didn't want me to.

I pushed my hair out of my face, and assured Collin that I was fine. "He won't hurt me, Collin|He leaves a koi-colored hand-print on my arm as he reaches for me, but I shake him off.

I stop at Amy's room and knock on the door.

No answer.

"What are you doing here?" There's a hitch in Harley's voice that I notice through the loud crowing that's started up in my left ear. I remember now-this was his former girlfriend's room before it was given to Amy|Dudda’s desperation must have given him a surge of strength as well, for with another kick of his good leg, he propelled himself enough to grip the wall and start pulling. Hereward wasted no time yanking Dudda’s girth until his body rolled onto the top. Then he realized that Dudda stood almost no chance of jumping.
Hereward ducked as another arrow sped past his hair. Dudda groaned with agony.
“Dudda, you have to get up and jump,” growled Hereward|"Now that you've had a moment to thank your lucky stars, tell me: why did you want to see that git of a half-demon so badly? I honestly can't imagine."
***

It took a while, but Cassie briefed the demon on everything that had happened since the morning of the time skip. From Sammael’s lack of response, she guessed that the demons already knew about the time skip|“I just thought, since you were at the base with my brother, and you do have that Italian look to you, that you were from here,” she replied.
“No, I’m actually from the same place you are: Alabama. However, I do have some ancestors from France. My parents said my genealogy traced back to royalty. Ha, Ha. Wouldn’t that be funny, me a prince.”
“Something tells me, you would be a great prince|So, to show gratitude, Irisa sent Zoe this card instead.”
“I will make sure Zoe sees this,” said Ana.
“Well, I should say goodbye, too,” said McKenzie. “I’ve got some more details to wrap up for this case.”
“I totally underestimated you,” said Ana|"That bird," I say, my voice dropping in embarrassment at how silly this is going to sound. "This is like the fourth time I've seen it since I got here. I think it's following me."

She glances over her shoulder at the bird. "How do you know it's the same bird|ordered Peter Hubbard, pushing a plastic cup to the space on the table between the two of them.
Alley wiped his mustache, poured whisky into the plastic cups and leaned forward over the bar to see around his brother.
“We seen you come in with Lizzy. You her husband?” He pointed at Jon with the neck of the bottle he held.
“He’d best be,” laughed Peter Hubbard as he picked up a plastic cup and turned to face Jon|"Across the pond, long before the door to a certain closet finally got kicked open."
"They couldn’t keep you in the closet if they bricked up the door," Michael retorted.
I’d heard all this before. "Aw, Jared didn’t get any cinnamon rolls!"
"Yes, he did," said Michael|She would sing along with it, especially if Dad wasn’t home to tease her about it.”
“It’s beautiful,” said Ananda.
Melissa nodded. “Yes, it really is.”
“Maybe you could ask your mother.”
“She wouldn’t remember.”
“Why?”
“Ever since her stroke,” said Melissa|There was no missing the love in his eyes, even though he kept his features completely stoic. "Does she need anything else?"

"No. She's married to a good man who owns the local mercantile."

Jess frowned as if the lawyer had said something wrong. "But?"

"I didn't say there was a but|Not only did he not fully trust the constable, but he also doubted the little man’s abilities to comprehend it. “We shall see what turns up.” 
“Where are you going, Inspector?”
He was turning off the path, towards a certain manor. “I have an important question to ask the good marquis.”

~~~

The sky was beginning to darken when he was ushered into the sitting room to wait for the marquis|Then sighting turned into spying, and spying turned to stalking. You could tell me how many pairs of jeans he owned before you officially knew his name.

"I'm not sure he's our type," I told you.

"Our type?" you said back. "I didn't know we had a type|It was at least a full minute before something he'd said finally registered-Savannah.

I'd forgotten all about Savannah.

Frantically, I whirled about, searching the crowd for her vivid hair. I didn't see her anywhere. Fear swelled in my throat like a suffocating balloon.

I started asking everyone I passed, "Have you seen Savannah|Charlotte glanced over her shoulder, waving her hands around like an air traffic control er. "Mads, you're going to welcome the crowd. Sutton, you'l enter from stage left-

your mark is a big X on the floor-with al the Homecoming Court sashes for the girls and guys. I'l come in from stage right. Sutton, can you open the box of sashes|If the school people had been planning on summer school classes, that wasn’t going to happen any time soon.  The building was full.  Cots had been set up in every room, including the gym.  As we walked down the hallway, it appeared the cots were fully in use.  Kids were running everywhere.  The room we were headed for was the auditorium.  Here, tables and chairs had been set up in every open area, including the stage|"Besides, the whole kingdom both adores Delia and absolutely despises her at the same time," Justice gazed at his wife as if he wanted to take whatever burden this meant on himself and carry it for her. "At the very least, she will be a distraction."

"What do you mean?" I asked.

"They love her because Lucan loves her and because she escaped and found life outside of the kingdom|Maybe it'll take your mind off of things."

Oh, no, she thought. No, no, no, no, no. Dancing with Dixon would put her mind on things she had no business thinking about. "I can't," she told him. She glanced out at the crowded ballroom, where scores of people were swaying across the dance floor, and she knew she couldn't have headed out there even if she did want to dance with Dixon|I don't think he would have eaten if I had not put some food near him." Ionun shook his head.
"Is that all he does?" Gaent asked.
"Oh no," said Ionun. "It might take a few days of planning, but with enough notice, he can perform a very wide variety of apothos."
"I've been dubious of the claims that the oinos make about their facere," said Gaent|"Okay, now, shut up," Doug said. "We've gotta go around back." He turned the lights and engine off and cruised.

The pumpkin patch was a huge fenced enclosure full of pumpkins, some piled up, some scattered across the ground. Doug stopped the Samurai just behind a large pile by the booth where you paid for the pumpkins|We walked a few more feet before he said, “She’s in one of my classes.”
“Are you friends?”
“I think so. I mean, she’s nice.” He sighed. “But she’s nice to everyone.”
“Is that bad?”
“I like that she’s sweet, but…”
“You can’t decipher why she’s nice|We stood and watched the sunset over the ocean waters wrapped around each other and never wanting to let go.

He led me back to the table as we ate dinner and talked. "I saw the tape your mom made for you; last night when we got back from the club and I slept on the couch. I turned the TV on and it was playing|What was that in Earth time? Or Laak'sa? For that matter, would time catch up to me? In Earth time, Ralph was gone more than eighty years. Would it catch up to him? Or me? Could I really have an age at all?
In my opinion, of course I had an age|Around and around, on and on, around her soft delicate neck, covering it up until only a little portion of the scarf lies lose over her shoulder. 
I look up at her reflection in the mirror when I finish the job. “You look nice with this scarf on too. I’ll buy you this scarf.”
“No,” Ivy says, pulling at the scarf|"Why did you kiss me when we were alone in the carriage?" she asked in a whisper.

She felt a slight shift in his shoulders at the question. "Would you rather that I had kissed you publicly?"

"What?" She was aghast. "Of course not!"

"Well, that's why I kissed you in the carriage|"I brought you some food. Do you feel better after your shower?"

"The bed," she responded, still not looking at me.

"Huh?"

Turning her head and locking her big sad brown eyes on mine, she said, "The bed. You said nothing had changed, but this is a different bed|Apparently, Le Jaunte had done much to undermine the Fleet before his departure.
“Who’s in charge here?” wondered the Admiral aloud, rising from his seat, his eyes still fixated on the projection. “Nathan, get me a secure channel to the Victory right away.”
Nathan fingered a control on his console and nodded to the Admiral|Just as I was setting the last photo on the mantle, I heard the door.

"Well, it's about time. I thought you got -"

I turned and saw Declan standing in the doorway, holding the biggest bouquet of red roses I'd ever seen. Next to him was Connor, holding a smaller version of the same bouquet|"I'm sorry, ma'am, but there's no one here with that last name."

"Are you sure?"

"I can check under his first name. What is it?"

I groaned. I'd never even bothered to ask King his full name. "I don't know. He just goes by..." I threw up my hands, "King|“Oh, hi, Julia,” she heard him saying. “Oh, that’s terrible! It won’t be the same without you, Julia. Don’t worry, there will be another chance to hear our jazz ensemble. I’ll make sure of it. You have a lovely afternoon, too, Julia|"What should I do? Should I make her throw up?"

"No, sir. That can cause more harm than good. The ambulance will be-"

Isabelle started seizing again, and Grant let the phone drop so he could keep her from hurting herself. He held her body tight against his and whispered into her ear, "You're going to be fine, Isabelle|'Well, she was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put it into her own hands, but I gave it into Barrymore's hands, and he promised to deliver it at once.' 
'Did you see Ms. Barrymore?' 
'No, sir; I tell you she was in the loft|Before Lindsey could protest, Steve followed Meg into the kitchen. "Do you know what that was about?"

Meg smiled and opened the refrigerator. "Nope." She took out the pizza box and set it on the counter.

Steve climbed onto the stool. "So what happened earlier?" he asked.

Meg hesitated, separating a piece of the pizza|The wolf hit the closed door hard, behind where she had just stood, and slid to the floor in an ungainly heap of long legs and sweeping tail.

Alexia backed away, hands up before her chest in an instinctive, and entirely useless, defensive position. She was not ashamed to admit she was deathly frightened. The werewolf was huge, and she was becoming convinced that what preternaturals could do would not be fast enough to cancel out what he might be able to do first|I checked my canteen and felt the heavy water sloshing around inside. I'd barely touched it today. I could make it last.
"I'm not going to let a storm steal away our answers again, Zee," I said. "I'm going after her. Tell Thorn that I'm finishing this."
Zach groaned and checked the weight of his own canteen|“Raina found him,” Evelyn whispered in my ear. “Two hours ago.”
“Alexander,” Tristan growled. The vampire flinched. “Come forth.” Alexander slowly walked up to the Council table and stopped just short of bumping into it. His eyes flickered to Ashley and then back to Tristan|Oddly enough, it didn't offer me the stranger's scent, carrying no more than the night, the ocean, and the multiple layers that spoke of the nearby restaurants, shops, and exhaust fumes.

If he was so close that I could hear him, I should certainly have been able to smell him. Unless, of course, he had no scent|The other vampire, a young member of my Novitiate class named Connor - and a very brief fling of Lindsey's - jumped to his feet, ready to join the fray.

"Connor!" Ethan yelled out. There was magic in his voice - his ability, as a Master, to call the vampires he'd made. Obediently, as if returning to the Pack and the alpha male, Connor bared his fangs at Jonah and the Grey House vamp, but slunk back against the wall, and behind Ethan|Kate's hand flew to her mouth. Her eyes widened seeing the entire Ritter property, including every room in the house, come into view. The pool where Joey splashed around sparkled in full color.

Richard flipped a switch and sound came over the speakers. "...let's see you do a handstand, Joey|Everything inside her demanded she keep going, even when she had to maneuver her body at odd angles to slither through the tunnel.

"Slow down, Joie," Jubal cautioned. "Stay within sight of us."

"I don't like the way she's acting," Gabrielle whispered. "I've never seen her like this. She always obeys the safety rules, you know that, Jubal|She had never been inside his house before. It was small and surprisingly neat for a man who lived alone. The furniture was sparse but of good quality. A number of photographs sat on the mantel. She moved closer for a better look. The first depicted a young couple holding a little boy. There were three other photos of the same couple|"Dirty's not, but I seriously do want to get to know you better. I feel like before now, our time has been stolen, rushed, whatever."

"That's fair. Okay, so where were we?"

"We talked about winter food. I'm curious what you'd say for the other three seasons|“Listen, Tim,” Teresa suggested once over the phone when he was on his way to Pat, “if you want to, I could come to your place. I mean, your hotel. I gather you do not feel comfortable in my apartment.”
“That is not the reason, Teresa|Sunny was instantly diverted. "You're using a candy bar as bait?" she demanded in outraged tones. "Give me that! You can use my nutrition bar in the traps."

He grinned and evaded her as she tried to swipe the remainder of the candy bar. "The nutrition bar wouldn't be a good bait|She returned to her bag, opening it up and taking out a couple of small cloth bags, opening each until she found the ones she needed. She took out a pale yellow pill and dropped the rest of the packets. Moving to stand next to Keiran, she looked down at Si.
“Si, I need to give you a pill|“Still, when you look at it closely, there is always a certain amount of faith involved in believing.” Then Ananda added, “There is no faith involved in knowing, in certainty.”
She pondered that for a while. “You’re right,” she said. “There is a difference.”
“Certainty is a constant seeing,” said Ananda|Why, of course, in his closet.

"Nice place you got here," said a voice from behind.

I spun around, catching the plate in my hand just before it crashed onto the floor. Storm was there, filling up my house with his black cloudlike self. "Seriously, man, don't you knock|"I remember when I was a new kid here ... the first time." He laughed to himself. "My band had just broken up and I was lost. I didn't know anyone. I could have used someone without" - he glanced at Arriane - "an agenda to show me the ropes."

"What, and you have no agenda|However, the commotion surrounding Dean’s narration was so captivating, only a few soldiers noticed; Harlin being one of them. Harlin pushed his computer off his lap, stepped to the front of his bunk and stood at attention. Others began to notice and came to attention. This ripple effect happened all around the room, until Dean was the only one not at attention.
Sergeant Major Kajo, Tiki Squadron Commander, stepped forward to be as close as possible to Dean|Those were the times when I knew that deep down he was still the same and, therefore, on some level at least, we must be the same. He opened his mouth as if he was about to say something, but the words were never spoken. Instead, he was interrupted by the waitress, who asked whether anybody wanted desert.
Linda, Ben and Paul eagerly turned to her and ordered|I had a hundred proofs. I had a hundred truths. Nothing worked. Charlie believed Jenny Flick.

"But you even know she's a mythomaniac!" I said.

"Stop using those big words. You sound like a f**king geek."

"Maybe I am a f**king geek|There was a crushing sound, however, as the Speedvan smashed against the rocks, and shards went splintering off and smashed against each other, the jagged protrusion from the cliff face and the sharp waves.
Clint and Clein clambered up the sides of the Fez and found a spot where they could sit that was much higher than they had ever been before. They looked Luc and saw the Nekken corner of Glix. They looked Shins and saw the other Nekken corner|"I called and Ms. Mayer said it would be all right to bring Baxter so the two of you can meet." Bending down to her constant friend and companion, Anne Marie said, "Baxter, this is Ellen."

Ellen stared at the dog. "Hi," she said and offered him her hand to sniff|Taking the phone from the cluttered counter, where dinner dishes awaited her-which she'd have to do before heading to work in the morning-Jane stepped out onto the porch and dialed Noah's number.

Wendy answered with a sleepy, "Hello?"

"Wendy, it's Jane."

There was a long pause. When Wendy spoke again, she was much more awake|Alexia fingered the dull gray shawl draped over her sister's faded dress. "Yes. Yes, it is."

Felicity huffed in annoyance. "I must go change for supper."

Lady Maccon looked her up and down, emitting a lip curl that was, quite frankly, remarkably Felicity-like. Sometimes, although not too often, there came an indication that they were, indeed, related|Upon arriving, however, LePage had integrated himself into the group of middle-aged, conservative political and business leaders gathered in the grand salon without drawing any undue attention to himself.  Dupuy and the Deschamps girl, neither of whom were dressed appropriately, had been led somewhere upstairs to await an audience with the Countess.   
Left alone with the other guests, LePage was left to consider the evident connection between Dupuy and the Deschamps girl|"It's just that it all doesn't seem real sometimes, even Mr. Tanner's being dead doesn't seem real. And Damon did look... well, exciting. But dangerous. I

"And besides, he wouldn't squeeze your throat; he'd cut it," Meredith said. "Or at least that was what he did to Tanner|It's not just annoying, but hypocritical. I mean, if I'm so lowly, then why did he want me?"

Andrus did not respond for several moments, then, "Even a dog is missed by its owner when it runs away. But it's still a dog."

Did Niccolo really think of her as his dog|Here are the events that occurred the morning your body was found:
Mrs. Green walks her dog Lilly, a small grey schnauzer @ 6:45 Saturday morning in Elizabeth Park. Meanwhile, no one was looking for you because you were never reported missing. Your parents believed you spent the night at Susanne’s. And Susanne, on the other hand, thought you hooked up with Neal and decided not to go to the dance. She ignored the unanswered texts she sent to you because, as she was quoted saying: “Penelope would always do this to me when she went back to Neal|Somewhere in Las Vegas there's an awesome woman who inspired someone in Kentucky to create the same type of program. I wonder if she knows what she does on a daily basis for girls like me.

"I thought the program in Kentucky could only provide shoes up to age seventeen."

"Eighteen now. They were given another grant. Maybe someday they'll be as big as the one in Vegas|"I haven't time for this," Reynaud growled. "There's a shooter, man."

"But... but, my niece is out there!"

"She's safe at the moment, sheltered by the carriage."

Reynaud assessed the crowd of soldiers gathered by the commotion in the entry hall. Except... except they didn't look like soldiers|The finely dressed man swore loudly. “Don’t touch me!” he shouted in a frantic tone. “Stay back!”
Jade felt her stomach flip. “Are you hit?”
“Hit?” Maklavir cursed again, moving carefully and awkwardly across the floor. “I’ll say I’ve been hit|Lizzie ate her entire plate plus a bowl of vanil a ice cream that had been left over from the last dinner we'd shared here when we'd laughed and made sundaes. She fed me little bites with her spoon and giggled, and for the first time, I smiled, unrestrained and uninhibited as I leaned in to tickle her tummy.

"I love you so much, Lizzie|Bella tried to bring some order back to her hair, her attire, and her emotions. At last, she faced him, and saw that he didn't look so hard and impenetrable as usual.

"Well, Jason," she said, bracingly. "Satisfied."

His lips tilted. "Hardly. I don't think a man could ever get enough of you, Bella|As the Survivor taught us."

Slowly, the members of the former crew nodded-even Sazed, though his face seemed troubled.

Cett just shook his head. "You people are all insane. How I ended up with you, I'll never know."

Breeze laughed. "Now, that's a lie, Cett|They had risen out of the ashes of the old world and as long as they remained in the sewers then one day there might come a generation more intelligent than the last, one who would be willing to communicate perhaps,” said Bear.
“Seems unlikely,” said Fin.
“Humans were once savage, unthinking apes...”
“Some might argue they still are,” Fin replied. “Still, I agree, the things don't deserve extinction just yet.”
“So all we had to do was find a way to drive them back underground,” continued Bear|When I awoke in 1978, I ordered his tube opened, and he walked right out, as healthy as he could be. The tube must also be some sort of healing device, a medical treatment pod of some sort. But its powers are limited to treating the living. I watched as Patrick Pierce, who had been as stoic as a judge for the past 20 years, crumbled into unimaginable grief as they pulled Helena's still-dead body from the tube|"Only the Prophet may open it..." "Two Pieces of Eden..."'

'Ezio?' Leonardo looked quizzical, doffing his eyeglasses. 'What is it? Does this ring some kind of bell with you?'

Ezio looked at him. He appeared to be coming to some kind of decision. 'We've known each other a long time, Leonardo|With the rest of the Bridge personnel now clear as to who was actually running the ship itself, Shiloh turned his attention to the displays that monitored the status of the fighters still in Defiant’s Hangar Bay. Most were showing the green light of ready-to-launch status. The Hangar Bay was in the process of depressurizing. All personnel there had already donned pressure suits. 

“Iceman to CAG.” 

The sudden voice made Shiloh jump. 

“Make it fast, Iceman. I’m kinda busy now,” said Shiloh|If I turn, then is my right still her right or does it become her left?
An easier way to tell the difference between a strumpet and a sister was to look at her clothes.  If the woman was wearing a plain long unrevealing gray dress with a headscarf then she was a strumpet.  If the woman wore a gaudy dress with a low cut front, a mini shirt, and had excessive makeup, then it was a sister|Yes it was a Dunlop 65. 'Here you are,' he called grudgingly. 'Oh no, sorry. You play with a Number One, don't you?'

'Yes,' came back Goldfinger's voice impatiently.

'Well, this is a Number Seven.' Bond picked h up and walked over to Goldfinger|He pushed a strand of red-gold hair away from her cheek. Asleep, she looked deceptively frail.

"She's a tough one," Lachlan said to his sister who had come to stand behind him. "For such a tiny lass, she has a lot of courage."

Flora squeezed his shoulder. "Don't let this one get away, Lachlan|As she studied me, moving closer and closer, I realized that Harriet was holding a small plate with a piece of cake upon it. I realized to my horror that it was my prize-winning cake!
“Here, little one,” she taunted me. “Wouldn’t you like a piece of your blue-ribbon cake? Or should Harriet say, her prize-winning cake|I plan on taking up my father's business, he would say, especially when he was around his father's friends. Usually that worked to impress girls too, Lexia included. His peers didn't ask. They didn't know what they were going to do after school either. This man was none of those things. Strangely, Lystus wanted to be honest with him. "I haven't decided," said Lystus|My sister insists that she gave her daughter a name that couldn't be shortened so that I'll call her what everyone else calls her. But I've taken to calling her Arin Marise just to rile her up. She's five and a half months old now, all cheeks and grins. Arin's petite like her mother but feisty. You only notice her small stature in comparison to Braden, Alayna's nephew who's only four months old, but almost twice as big as Arin|Now her momentum is gone. If she leaves here, where will she go? A place of greater safety? She doubts there is one.

That evening when Audrey closes shop, she treats Risa to something special.

"I've noticed your nails are in pretty bad shape. I'd like to give you a manicure|“Wow, there are so many cars here,” Holly says as she looks around.
Bryson looks over his shoulder and scans the parking lot. “Yeah, there’s actually a lot more than last year.”
As the four of us walk around, we stop and gawk at pretty much every car we come across. Even though I know Becca and Holly came for me, I’m happy to see they genuinely do seem to be fascinated by the cars|Sandy asked the woman.
“Yes, I’ve come for Bartley Long’s things.”
“Oh, are you his mother?”
“No, I’m Ms. Creadle, his nanny. His parents are on cruise, and I am taking care of Bartley this summer.”
“Oh, I see,” Sandy said cautiously, “Have you seen Bartley|"How did you find out?" she asked, trying again, her tone sharpening. "You and Carter don't run in the same circles."

Griffin shrugged.

"My father put you up to this, didn't he?" she accused.

When he continued to look at her implacably, she said, "Answer the question, Griffin|Like a man afraid a pebble might pop up at any moment and put a scratch on his car.  He probably drove around puddles, too.
She couldn’t complain though.  His grandma driving gave her time to marvel at the art studios and galleries with their stucco buildings and clay tile roofs.  She’d always dreamed of spending her life working in her own studio|They sat in the front room with a folder she brought, which remained closed at first.  “You know that guy I had you check out in the Army?”
“Yeah, Sergeant Montes.”
“Right.  Well, I met with him in Mexico last night.”
“Okay, so you went to Mexico|His serious spiel melted into laughter.

Getting up, I walked over and knelt beside him. "What?"

He pointed to the bottom row of DVDs. I read the titles. High Fidelity. Better Off Dead. Say Anything. Grosse Pointe Blank. All John Cusack movies.

"I knew it," I breathed, thinking of the demon's coincidental resemblance to the actor|he asked, curiosity in his voice.
“I’m going to report you to the principal.”
“What?” he asked, flabbergasted.
“Calling your students stupid is totally irresponsible and inexcusable.”
“Calling my students stupid?” he asked, his tone puzzled. 
“Yes, Ema told me you had called her stupid|"I just don't," she stated with every ounce of belief she possessed.

"Give me something to go on here. I'm trying to understand."

"Sam and Beverly were not suicidal. I knew them. I'd bet my life on it."

Grant's mouth flattened at her choice of words. "Okay, let's say that's true and they weren't suicidal|And while Jane glared at her and Jackson stepped back, smiling slightly, she went on quickly, still staring at the sand, saying, “I think he should be the lead explorer, because that was his wish you know, and anyway, I think he would make a good leader, so there!”  And she sat down on the sand and hid her head before Jane could start shouting at her.
“Jinx!  You’re voting for Jinx here to lead us, after all you said about his being a Robinson too!  That isn’t even fair, he doesn’t know anything about leading|Jim handed me back my Book, and the pages made that comfortable crinkling sound as I replaced Becca’s notes and slid the Book into my back pocket.
“You had it word for word,” he said.
“I enjoy that particular book.”
“My mother says you do that all the time. She says you’ve got the whole thing memorized|I slowed down, shoving a yellow piece in the midst of several pink ones, and began to pretend to think hard, even though my mind was mentally fitting the pieces with ease and I was almost done with the puzzle. I didn't want to be first. It'd be a death-knell for us if we were first|Gladys began nervously looking for the exit.
"That must be complicated," she said.
"We do it on our smart phones," the alien said. "The manufacturer doesn't advertise that feature, but you can activate it by downloading special software.
"It's good to have software," said Gladys|On the one hand, they'd helped make the pies, and now helped bake them, which was really sweet, but on the other hand, they were plotting to keep her from taking them to the fair to be sold.

"So I'll take the pies for you?"

"No, that's okay," Elvi said. "I'll take them."

Karen bit her lip, and then admitted, "I don't think they're going to let you out of the house, Elvi|He's quiet, and I'm not removing my finger until it prunes and falls off."

He seemed caught between the two scenarios, unsure which was worse. "Dios, fine. Come help with the bath then."

She trudged after him, and he peeked in on the other two. "You guys stay right here and play until Luke is out of the bath|“Micah doesn’t drink,” she announced. She raised her half-empty glass. “Can you believe it? He’s my designated driver. Except that we walked here. He’s my designated walker!” She lifted her drink to her lips and emptied it.
She slammed her glass down and locked eyes with Micah|“Apart from his kissing me, nothing really happened.” 
Aaron was not satisfied. Pulling away from her, he turned around, allowing the flames roiling within him to pour from his mouth in a long, steady stream.
“A kiss is not nothing,” he said over his shoulder. “And given the chance, he would have made sure a lot more happened|She thought Collin may be alive. "He can't be alive, Al. I saw the pit. You don't need to sugarcoat things for me. I know I won't see him again."

"I don't know," she answered. "When Shannon comes in, ask her about the pit|"The castle was commissioned by a man named John Philippe Knight-built as a home, a sanctuary-a place to end all journeys. And so, he named it after the place he believed to be the afterlife."

"So, why do they call it the Castle of Death?"

"Of the Dead," Eric corrected, becoming smaller beside Arthur.

"Because-" Arthur turned his head slowly to look away from Eric|I look over this earnest sea of heads as they solemnly bob up and down, assuring the pastor of their affection and devotion. “That was my mission, but it is no more.” 
This smashing surprise causes submerged emotions to surfaces. They lash out and clash on the rock of this church. I hear among the congregation rumblings of, “What are you saying pastor|The scene changed and there stood the Canadian reporter with an eager expression on his face.
“You betcha, Nick!”
The control room decided to let the northern newsman get a little face time so the picture stayed on him.
“Wally, can you tell us what is happening right now as we speak?”
“Um, well, nothing’s happening right now, Nick|Gray clapped his brother on the shoulder and said, "You do realize when you two are on your honeymoon, Suzy and I are going to christen every surface in your apartment."

Beth could feel her face turning red as Nick snickered. "Sorry, Gray," Beth mumbled.

Gray laughed softly, "No worries, Beth|They were in a jovial mood - even Selena, who had never adapted well to early rising - and their progress was a joy to behold.
Their father, too, appeared to be cautiously caught up in the stir of things. He took his morning tea with the girls, and upon his wife's request, attempted to educate them about the Principality of Wales.
"Originally under Roman rule, Wales came into its own in the fifth century," Mr. Jenney related, until he was interrupted by Selena|“Well, it must have been the gloves. I hadn’t even
administered the anaesthetic yet and she began gasping
and writhing around. All I’d done up until then was hold
an oxygen mask over her face. So unless she was allergic
to pure air. It must have been something to do with the
gloves|he said, pointing at Kendril. “I told you I’d ‘ave no trouble in my inn!” 
The barmaid retreated a few steps in fear. 
The Ghostwalker reached the bottom of the stairs. His eyes swept meticulously over the room. 
Maklavir finally managed to replace his sword. “I think you’ve stirred things up here a bit, Kendril|It allowed me to sort through my thoughts.

I was already unloading the dishwasher and putting the dishes in their proper places when I felt Ben's hands hold my waist. He pulled my back against him, his lips falling on the nape of my neck.

I paused what I was doing. "What is this between us, Ben|The ghola saw her indrawn breath, the tightening of her cheeks, said: "Is it your time?"

"I... yes, it is."

"You must not delay," he said. He grasped her arm, hurried her down the hall.

She sensed panic in him, said: "There's time|"I'm under the impression that the security establishment knows nothing about the Joranumites. That may mean that the Joranumites no longer exist or that, if they do, they are of no importance. It may also mean that the security establishment just isn't interested. Nor is there any way in which I can force it to be interested|Well, he's actually not my uncle, he's my Godfather but I couldn't say Godfather when I was little so he told me to call him uncle.  He told me I looked like my grandmother," said Vanessa. 
"Do you think we could be some kin to one another?" I asked.
"It's the only logical explanation for us resembling each other to the point of almost looking like twins," said Vanessa|He pulled himself up and over, slammed his hand into the thing's skin and ripped out the handle.

Thomas dropped to the ground and turned to the fourth pod, but the Griever was moving, its front end slipping up and over the edge of the open pod, appendages bursting out of the skin to help it maneuver. Thomas barely reached it in time, jumped up and heaved himself over the side of the pod|Julian held fast to Camille's hand, backed up a step and used the tip of his foot to drag the chair up. "I'm here for the duration," he said, and sat down.

Claudette stepped closer to Tasha. "Let's go get some coffee."

Tasha nodded.

"Can we get you anything, Julian|Normally he didn't bring women home with him, an unwritten rule that went along with his distrust of females.

Yet he'd done both with Annabelle and for that reason he wanted to answer her unasked question now. "I bought these after you came to stay."

Her gaze softened. "I don't know whether to be flattered or mortified you think I'm easy|He was tossing newly minted apartment keys in his hand; I'd insisted that if he was going to marry me, he'd have to start doing more mundane, human things, too, such as unlocking doors the standard way, and knocking before entry. He'd found it funny, of course. But he humored me.

"Just getting the package," I said, and bent down again to pick it up.

As my fingers closed around it, David asked, in pure puzzlement, "What package|It was her only hope of escaping the life that Ian had forced upon her."

Graeme's jaw bulged and he flexed it as he clamped his teeth together. 'Twas obvious he was battling his anger, and Bowen didn't want that anger to go unchecked.

"There's something else you should know, Graeme|Paige banged on the window with her fist.  Nicholas turned and looked at her.  Eddie looked at her.  She gave Nicholas the finger.  It was crude, rebellious, but she hoped it would be effective.  Maybe it would offend his need for discipline and control.
Nicholas gave her a little smile and wave, then, raising the blade, turned back to Eddie|"I wish you wouldn't talk like that," my mother said. "He's gone to the helicopter."

"The. Helicopter."

My mother barely looked up from the television. There was nothing new in my tone to alarm her. "Marshall got him a seat. Said because he was such a good shot, it wouldn't be wasted|"Well, now you have a place to stay, so you don't need to worry about it."

"Oh, no. I couldn't impose on you like that."

"It's not an imposition. It's an opportunity."

His grin is devilish.

"Dare I ask what kind of opportunity|“I wrote everything up even though I know you want to do some of the work yourself.” Phil handed him a spiral-bound booklet.
“What did you find?” Sean asked.
“The old girl has good bones. She’s structurally sound, but she needs more than just simple cosmetic work.” Phil flipped open his own copy of the booklet|I looked at her, thinking she was trying to get my attention, but it turned out she was clearing her throat at a couch that stood with its back to me, facing the windows. The maid cleared her throat again, louder this time, and suddenly, a young girl rose from the couch. She literally materialized right in front of me. I reflexively took a step backwards, right onto the foot of the maid|Broey crossed to the head of the conference table, flipped the toggle which activated his communicator, addressed the screen which only he could see.

"Assemble the Council and link for conference."

The response came as a distorted buzz filtered through scramblers and suppressed by a privacy cone. Gar, standing across the room, could make no sense out of the noises coming from the communicator|I retreated, clambered over the pod and fell back in the room. The immortal stretched her legs over the pod in the doorway and approached. I’d been so close.
It said, “The police have been notified and are on their way.”
I needed only minutes. I gripped the metal bar tight in both hands and brought the full force of my body swinging down on the immortal|After the devastation of the tsunami wiping out our largest city, we had known it would come to this. But if we had needed any verification, the two ominous spacecrafts floating behind the building were our proof.

Our society had taken precautions when our people had first landed on Joyal. With our planet's lesser size, and the risk of natural disaster such as we'd had last week, our founders had made a deal with the Mian and the Kireg in exchange for our some of our technology|I put my hands inside my pocket and found the coins I took from Kino.  I took one, then, I aimed at the pig again, and when I was pretty sure I could hit one, I threw.  There! Half-way in mid-air, the coin showed and it glittered under the blazing sun.  It landed on the head of the same pig|To make her dance happen, not only had Fen written a song for her and sang it publicly, he had to have enlisted the aid of other Carpathians for the music and the show of stars on the ceiling.

"Thank you," she whispered almost shyly, slipping her arms around his neck and leaning into the shelter of his body. "I don't know what to think about you, sometimes, Fen|He released Treloar's wrist and was pleased by the residual pain he saw in the medical officer's eyes.

"It just seems too much of a coincidence that first, Smith was in Venice, now he's here," Treloar said.

"Believe me, Smith knows nothing. He has nothing. Danko was dealt with before he could say anything. And there's a simple explanation as to why he was in Venice|'Well, I'll ask you to return to your bunks, ladies, and not to come out again unless it's an emergency. You know we don't have our marine guard tonight, and there's meant to be a strict curfew in place.'

'I'm sure we'll be fine now,' said Frances.

'Orders, you know,' said the officer.

'Yes, we know,' replied Frances|“Yes, it’s important to look through the lenses you were born with sometimes,” said Vo. They both laughed.
“Mind if I walked with you a bit?” said Vo.
“Not at all,” said Ana, “but you were walking in the other direction.”
“I was not going anywhere in particular,” said Vo|Ben hung up angrily which Willow found ironic. “Maisy, you don’t have to change for practice today. Daddy had an emergency at work come up so you’re going to go to speech therapy with me and Tommy.”
“Is Daddy ok?” she asked coming into the kitchen.
“Oh, yes, not that kind of emergency|The young girl with eyes lacking any guile walked up to us and stared at Honey.
“Is that your real hair?”
Honey squirmed in the plastic chair. “Yes.”
“Mine’s a wig. I don’t like it. It makes my head hot. But Mom says I should wear it, ’cause it makes people uncomfortable to see me bald|Her mother's words to her and her siblings when they were growing up echoed in her head:
“Only stupid people get bored,” she would say. “You have the capacity to entertain yourselves, to read a book, play the piano, invent a song, game or story. Your genetic code is embedded with the facilities to not be bored|It wasn't Ari. It was his business manager and Rafe leaned back as he prepared himself for an hour-long call. Work. This was good. This was the distraction he needed.

His cell phone shook against his desk and he glanced at it briefly without thinking much about it. Suddenly, he did a double take, because there was a message and it was from Ari|Then she said, “This kind of seeing, this kind of sculpting has one major requirement. That requirement is stillness.”
She let that sink in before continuing, “Plotinus also held that we are all beautiful when we are true to our own being, when we know ourselves. In self-ignorance, he added, we are ugly|My father was a French noble who inherited Brittany from his wife."

"Your mother."

"No." She gives a quick, firm shake of her head. "Not my mother. His first wife, the heir to Brittany, died years before I was born. My mother was also named Marguerite, but she was Marguerite of Foix, not Brittany|"If ye want to leave, I'll send ye home to Dunscaith tomorrow," Connor said, though he prayed she would not go.

He loved her so much.

* * *

Was her happiness to end this quickly? Connor called Dunscaith her home, but it could never be that without him. She had no home.

"What do you want me to do, Connor|A moment later, Otis appeared from behind the door and nudged his father. Miles shifted the gun, taking aim at Otis. Like his father, he didn't seem particularly worried.

"Step aside, Daddy," Otis said calmly. The sight of Otis's face made Miles want to pull the trigger. Biting back the wave of choking rage, he raised himself, keeping the gun pointed at Otis|Aria's mouth dropped open. Her Time Capsule flag? "Excuse me?"

An owl hooted. A cloud shaped like a hand floated over the moon. Courtney threw a clump of frozen moss down the well. Aria didn't hear it hit the bottom. "I know Jason gave you the flag|Adam lifted a hand, asking for a moment, and typed at his station. A new image appeared on the screen. "Here's a stylized pagan spiral. You can find variations of this around northern Europe."

Another tap at the screen placed the spiral over the quartered circle.

"See how the spiral starts at the center of the cross and expands outward to fill the circle|Since I was out of town this week, someone at the school must've thought they were doing me a favor and sent it off."

"Some favor."

"This wasn't what I wanted." Libby looked at him beseechingly. "You have to believe me. I forgot all about it. Especially after we spent the weekend trying to work things out."

"Did we work things out, Libby|We're not going after them.

They're coming to us." The two men looked at each other, then back at Tanner.

"What?" "Diane Stevens and Kelly Harris will be here at KIG Monday morning at eleven-fifteen."

KELLY AND DIANE awakened at the same time. Kelly sat up in bed and looked over at Diane|Now, a long time after Brent and his dog had left, long enough that Jessie really didn’t know how much time had passed, she sat at the counter and stared at her mother.  “Dogs bite,” she said, trying to give Gail a subtle hint about what had happened the last time they had a dog.  
Her mom drank down half the wine in her glass and laughed.  “Oh, dogs don’t really bite that much, Jessie|To my surprise, the door was cracked open, and I could see two figures inside through the frosted glass. I'd just raised my hand to knock when a voice drifted out to me.

"But I don't want to be a healer," someone muttered. "I never wanted to be a healer|I grew comfortable with him, grew accustomed to his roving, loving gaze on my body as I changed, or showered, or simply lay nak*d in bed, writing, after we made love. His attention grew familiar, but never loses its power to stun me.

Like him.

Listen to me, though. Like it's been decades, instead of days|"The key to the vault?" Sophie translated.

"No, that's the literal translation. Clef de voute is a common architectural term. Voute refers not to a bank vault, but to a vault in an archway. Like a vaulted ceiling."

"But vaulted ceilings don't have keys|All these thoughts flashed through her mind in the moment it took for Sophia’s eyes to meet the big beautiful turquoise blue eyes of the infant dragon.  Somehow, her heart seemed to connect with the dragon through those gentle orbs.  Her anxiety miraculously and instantaneously morphed into a motherly manifestation of warmth and tenderness.  “No, he’s not dangerous,” agreed Mom kindly, as she reached out her hand and gently caressed the cheek of the baby dragon|She had her bow and was out the door while Palsamon was still lacing his boots. The sound was coming from the old smoking shed, out near where Faldorin's Path began. Meledrin quickly made her way in that direction.
There was nobody ahead of her, but she was pleased to see that others were stirring in the buildings behind.
A few moments later she saw a man kneeling in front of the shed|He probably would have."

I kick at the big orangey-red flowers, like tiger lilies, that line the edge of the pool.

The couple on the bench are really going at it. The man's got one hand up the woman's shirt, another hand down her pants. Elder follows my gaze and stares at the couple|Nick didn’t have as much luck getting unstuck from the mud. We got a little ways back down the road, then realized Nick wasn’t behind us.
I looked back. “Uh oh,” I said. His car was stuck. Holt looked in the rearview mirror. “We’ll have to help.”
He stopped the car and got out and the two of us got out and walked back to Nick|To Hansen, he continued,

"Additionally, the parameters of the trip have changed, and our delegates will be bringing their wives."

"Some of us don't have wives, your piousness," Hansen reminded him.

"Then you'll bring concubines. I'm sure Elaina will enjoy the trip.

We'll discuss it later." The Grand Disciple was so caught up in his plans now that he didn't notice the transformation that took place in Hansen's face at the mention of Elaina|Magdalene screamed up the last bit of the scale at the same time that I crashed down to the very bass range of the Steinway, and when the last ringing note died, she got herself another drink.

I wondered if she was supposed to be the disaster at the sidelines.

I heard slow clapping. Jeremy and Leyla had arrived, as had "the boys" - the sound techs. The oldest of the techs was the one clapping|Cassie saw, to her outrage, that Deborah was going through her backpack, throwing things out one by one. "Not much," the biker said, tossing it on the ground so the rest of its contents scattered down the hillside.

"All right." Faye was smiling again, a particularly unpleasant smile that made her red lips look cruel. "I think you were right the first time, Deborah|My eyes were full of tears ready to burst out, and I could only see a haze in front of me.
All of a sudden, I caught a glimpse of a hand grabbing Colin’s wrist and, through the curtain of my misted eyes, I was able to see Colin staring at Christopher, his eyes wide with surprise.
‘Are you all right Emma?’ Christopher asked me, without taking his eyes off Colin|Out of sight of my house, I turned to her.
“Are you in trouble?” Addie asked. Stupid question. I was usually in trouble.
“Not really,” I said. “I think I should lay low for a while.”
“You are, too, in trouble,” said Addie|It wouldn’t surprise anyone that you
would take your own life.”
“You’re sick, Rose. Twisted and sick!” Anna spat back at
her.
“But now, with what you have told me about Tessa, well,
that is simply extra cream for the filling isn’t it?”
“What makes you so sure that I haven’t told the police
what Marla has told me, Rose|You two stop making insinuations!"

"What's an in-sin-u-a-tion?" Avery whispered, sounding out the word carefully.

"It's when you say one thing, but really mean another," I whispered back. She nodded.

"So what is this scholarship? You graduate at the end of the semester-why would you need a scholarship|"Wait," said Mae. She gestured to two of the older girls and nodded toward the unconscious servant. "Drag her out. She's coming with us."

One of them frowned. "Why take her? She's not worth anything."

"I'm taking her for the same reason I'm taking all of you," said Mae|“We aren’t out of danger yet,” Horatius said. He headed northwest without thinking about it. It just seemed the right way to go.
Chloe squirmed as she became more alert. “We have to go back. Now. We can’t leave my house burning with my family in there.”
Horatius didn’t know what to do about the fire|The mighty dragon possessed by Solharn was defeated.
Deo immediately landed. By now Deke had long since relinquished Mary’s hand and climbed up through the hole. Delca ran to his side. “Is Mary alright Deke?” 
“Yes, she is resting.”
Delca ran to look after Mary as Deke looked over toward the dragon|And with the Aqua Festival happening in one day, the Water District would be even busier than usual.
Every time there was a holiday or a special event, a district would host an event of festivity for everyone who celebrated it. Sometimes the Forest District would host it, and sometimes the Fire District. It was different for every event. This time around the Water District was hosting it, and it was called the Aqua Festival|This is a painting by my grandmother? Unbelievable.” She examined the painting closely. “And it’s oil, too.” She stood back and stared at it for a moment. “Nice brushwork. I’m impressed. With her work, not just the subject.”
Beatrice nodded slowly, keeping her eyes on the painting|"You don't have to cook for me."

Boy, this girl was a hard sell today. "You don't have to eat it. I'm sure Karen and Zach will like the leftovers." She rolled up her sleeves and washed her hands. "Can you grab the bread?"

Judy watched from the corner of her eye as Dina stepped into the pantry and removed a loaf|Undoubtedly a transport error, the lower legs of the man are simply gone, sheared off just above his knees. Geramn kneels beside the bed and takes the man’s hand. “Nor, I am sorry to trouble you. However, can you tell me where the dragons go to battle?”
The man opens his eyes and takes a moment to focus on Geramn|The smile in her eyes is about as faint as my sarcasm: noticeable, but not meant to be blatant. I'm sure she's heard and experienced worse. And I'm pretty sure she knows I have a fear of hospitals not unlike a large percentage of the population.

I can go in one just fine, but not when I'm the patient|Over the next few seconds it was touch and go as to whether or not she would throw the cane aside and simply beat me to death with her bare hands. Judging by her facial contortions the internal struggle was enormous but eventually she straightened and in a quiet, steel-tipped voice, ordered me once again to put out my hand. And again she teased it into the optimum position with the tip of her cane|"I need some time to get my head around this myself."

A few minutes later, Olivia was lying thoughtfully on the floor of the living room when Ivy let out a long, sad sigh from her place on the couch. "What is it?" Olivia asked, staring at the light gray ceiling.

"I just remembered we're supposed to move to Europe in, like, just over a week," replied Ivy|"It's the first time in my life that I've purchased my own car. I negotiated the deal myself," Lillie announced proudly. "And I had all my facts straight before I even walked inside. Those salesmen take one look at me and see dollar signs. I needed to prove to them-and to myself-that I'm no pushover|A tall man in a brown coat and a three-piece suit was helping her with her luggage.
Fiona rushed over to help, and Flannery noticed her concern.
“Oh, don’t fuss,” she said with a weak smile. “I’m just fine.”
“Don’t fool yourself, you’re not fine,” said Fiona.
“I’m not fooling anyone,” said Flannery|He looked to be about forty years old, with a dark, heavy beard and an unruly mat of graying hair. He was dressed in a ragged red union suit and held an ancient muzzle-loading rifle in his hands. In the dim lamplight, Jason caught a glimpse of a woman and several children huddled together in the middle of the single-room hut.
"I never heard of no Vigilance Committee," Bowles said gruffly|Fury poured into Eden's veins and she clutched the sword in her hand with a steady grip. Calmly she stepped out to face the soul eater, who sneered at her as if she were nothing but a mere annoyance.

"They sent babies to do a man's job."

"Well, you know what they say about babies|Grant's eyes were on me, and the pleading in them almost had me buckling without even considering the outcome. "We can't live with your brother, and I can't live without you. I want you with the best doctors, sweet girl. Please, come back with me. Let me keep you safe."

Mase cleared his throat, but I didn't turn away from Grant|They were silent as Adrian went from side to side and dipped his oar low in the water taking as much as he could to keep their course steady.  He could see that they were going to fall short of the ship, but at least they would make it to the other side.
“We are almost there.”  Orwell called out.
“Good.  Tell me which way and how hard I need to row|Her phone rang just when she was about to push her tray back. When she saw her stepdad's number, she decided to call him back a little later. She didn't think she could take his heartbreak over her mom this early.

Her phone chimed with an incoming text. Couldn't be her dad, the man didn't text|Katie was at Shane's side, looking at me

curiously. I still didn't know what this woman was up to, but somehow I believed she was on Melanie's side. I felt confident she only wanted what was best for my girl.

I reached my hand to hers, taking it. "It was a pleasure to meet you, Katie|The swelling in her face had receded a little, but her skin remained a deep purple.
Katja smiled. “You look good.” At least, as good as someone who got beat up the day before could look. “Before we go to the doctor we have to go to the police station. I know you don’t want to…”
“I do, Katja|"He will."

She shrugged. "That would be for the best, I suppose. Of course if Penelope were reined in, we wouldn't meet such interesting people as the Ghost of St. Giles."

"You make light of the danger."

"Maybe I do, Your Grace," she said gently, as if he were the one who should be reassured, "but I must admit it was exciting to see the Ghost|She bought a casual dress and sandals for the evening, and also a pair of Capri's and tank top with a sweater to wear to the beach. After depositing her purchases in her room, she hopped a bus for the beach, where she walked for a couple of hours. Her bus got caught in traffic on the way back to town. She asked a person seated near her why there was so much traffic|I didn't answer. The plane rattled its way through another set of bounces, and I didn't have enough breath in my lungs to curse, because my diaphragm didn't want to function. Maybe, if I held my breath long enough, I'd just pass out. That would get my mind off of the flight|"Do you guys see that little light?" I ask. "Look at Europe."

"Oh, yeah," Sam says. He waits for another rotation and then squints. "I would say that's in what? Spain or Portugal? Can someone reach the laptop? Hurry."

With my eyes still on the globe and the tiny pulsing light, I crash my hand around behind me until I find the laptop|Though it jammed against her outstretched arm, crushing her fingers, she managed to keep them pressing into the book.
And that was all it took.
With every scrap of determination and attention she could muster, she fought against her allergies, and blasted magic into every page. She didn’t have time for a well-thought-out spell|While Max saunters along whistling “No Where Man”, I’m often pounding the trail a few hundred yards ahead and breathlessly singing “Running on Empty.” On a rare occasion we might find common ground in a tune like “Let it Be” or “Stairway to Heaven”. Somewhere along the way, though, a subtle change had come over Max|One was a girl of nine or ten with her father's straight, fine brown hair. Her brother was a few years younger. They stared at me with wide eyes, at Zach and then up at their father. Sam's lined face was pale and his kids began to cry.
"These are my children," said Sam|How many dream lifetimes have I lived? Is anyone else still alive on this frozen planet? Where did my parents go when they left the compound? Will I ever break the endless cycle of entering the chamber in which I’m trapped? What is the point of living a life of forgetfulness? With these thoughts racing, I return to the chamber|When the owner died, they closed it up. They've been trying to find a renter. With a little elbow grease, it could make a great location." He paused and looked at her. "If you wanted to open that bookstore in Mystic."

The fantasy broke apart. They both knew that her life wasn't in Mystic|It had been years since I had even spoken about that night. It never got any easier to talk about it.

Kane didn't try to talk to me about it anymore. Instead he just sat there and held me 'til my eyes couldn't manage any more tears.

After I had expelled the last tear from my eyes, I wiped the moisture from my cheeks and looked at Kane|Mareth was her coach, and he wasn't afraid to chew her out.

"Oh, Mareth, how long are you to stay angry with me?" said Luxa. "It has been at least a day already. No one will blame you for my disobedience."

"That is much beside the point, Luxa|He worked off the stopper with his teeth, feeling the fires blaze around him. The far wall was nearly gone. The fires crept toward h1im.

He drank the contents of the vial, then searched inside of himself, seeking tin. But there was none. Spook cried out in despair, dropping the vial|She sits at a single table among many, a row of round bulbs surrounding rectangular mirrors, but hers alone are lit. The ceiling is high, the walls far off on every side, the stage an even wider, higher, more open place than any mountain or rooftop or city hall. The stage is huge enough to handle ballet or opera or a cast of hundreds. There are five thousand empty seats, on the ground, in the mezzanine, and in the balcony|‘I’m trying to say, Mary, that I don’t know how to court you.’
Mary smiled and it made him glow inside. ‘Oh Archie.’ She squeezed his hand harder than she meant to. ‘Oh Archie, I know.’
‘Do you? Do you know what you mean to me, Mary|And I blinked, seeing the badass Elder Zeller...grinning...flashing white teeth down at Isa. Guess he liked the little ones. "Yes, she is." I watched his hand closely as he raised it, tipping her chin up with a light finger to stare down into her face, smiling at her. He bent, softly saying at her level, "It's nice to meet you, Isa|Her face looks confused.
“There’s nowhere I’d rather be than here with my parents telling me the story of my life.” I take another step ahead.
“You’re not angry with me?” Mother holds her breath, waiting for my answer.
“I’m tired of being angry with you, Mother|Murphy pushed a button on the remote and the sky parted into a square hole where a ladder fell downward. He tossed the remote over to Zeke. "Don't lose that remote, without it you'll never get into the rewot again. It is worth more than a Paladin's life." He covered his mouth. "Sorry, habit."
Zeke pretended he didn't hear the comment as he caught the remote|The peace between our races is fragile and I, for one, believe that it is important we foster that peace."

Gilda released his shirt and looked back at Helen as if nothing had happened between them. She offered no apology for her behavior or insult.

"She is a liability," said Gilda|****

For the next few days and even weeks, I’m always cautious with my cell, home phone, and walkabouts. I look at my caller ID first before answering. If it’s an unknown number, I refuse to answer it and let it go to voicemail. For our home phone, I always let Gigi answer it. Mandy hardly calls me on my home phone. But if she does, she would text me first to tell me she’ll be calling|“So how are you, Anna?” asked Max.
“I’m doing well.”
“Your mom and dad,” added Max, “I assume they are well too?”
“They’re fine,” she said.
“Ian told me that they had been ill.”
Anna glanced at me and then looked at Max|“There’s no time,” said Duke.  “You said there was a hostage incident under way at the downtown Ottawa Gordo’s, didn’t you?”
“Well, yes,” said Coplawyer.  “Apparently I got the call by radio in-between chapters.”
“So there’s no time to waste,” said Duke|Three massive oak tables, their surfaces smooth as glass, are situated in a triangle pattern on top of the platform. Scrolls and books are piled high on all three. The chairs around the table are filled with people perusing the scrolls or writing in ledgers. Geramn pauses at the bottom of the platform, trying to decide who it is he needs to approach.
A stooped-shouldered elder, his hair sticking up in silver wisps around a bald crown, looks down at Geramn|She held out her hand as he split the cupcake into two pieces, but instead, he lifted it to her lips. She opened and took the bite, intentionally letting her lips brush his finger. 
“See what I mean?” he asked when she licked it off his finger.
“Oh, it’s amazing,” she agreed, only she wasn’t talking about the cupcake|He looked across the short, smoky distance, directly into Ronson's eyes, and signaled left, away from the sand, towards the jungle that pressed in from behind them. A quick sideways flick of his own eyes told him that Johnson and Phillips had caught it too. Beeker signaled Ronson out first, then Phillips, and then Johnson|The grease is going to be difficult to wash off if you let it harden."

"I'm not your scullion," he told her.

"Wash the dishes, Garion," she ordered him, nibbling at the tip of a lock of hair.

"Wash them yourself."

She glared down at him, biting rather savagely at the unoffending lock|"Oh," she said disdainfully, "that's completely out of fash now. I have a new one from Sweden; you haven't seen it. I'll wear that, if it's permitted. The girl at A and F wasn't sure."

"It's a deal," he said, and rang off.

A half hour later in his Jaguar he landed on the elevated field of her conapt building|"I think," she started then paused and went on warily, "I'm not sure but I don't think Alistair was very," she hesitated again then finished, "nice to them. Any of them."

Cash caught her meaning. Alistair not being "nice" included Nicola.

In a low voice that came directly from his gut, he knew because he felt it, Cash promised, "He's going to pay."

Abby's arms flexed around him and she warned, "Be careful, Cash|The redheaded secret service agent walked alongside, talking into his sleeve.

Hank stayed ever-present in step, his strides a loose march, snow spiraling around their feet. She gripped his arm, her velvet bag dangling from her elbow. She wasn't sure why she'd been so insistent on carrying the creche herself. It would have been simpler to include it with the luggage|Brandywine stood and started looking around at the walls. “No, but Samuel always spent a lot of time knocking on walls and spent a lot of time in the cellar. But it’s under the kitchen and not part of the house. Never would tell me or his mother what he was doing.”
“Do you mind if I see the cellar|“If we had access to a Concession train...”
“Nope, no good,” Fluky replied, opening his beer. “That right there, that's Stephenson gauge,” Fluky gestured with his Frau at the tracks below him. “56.5 inches. All that Concession stock, that's mega-gauge: 78.75 inches|“But he doesn’t know our faces or our masks—”
“And that’s the problem,” Becca says, grabbing her things and throwing them in her bag, including the black box. “Everyone is starting to get ID’s with both their faces and masks on them, and pretty soon everyone is going to have to have it. I know if we don’t have that, they’ll automatically know that we’re the Maskless.”
Eduard nods and looks at Mikey, who walks up and hands the book to Becca|"Quick enough for you, baby?" Liam drawled.

Her lips curled with amusement. "That was amazing. Thank you."

She turned to face Noah, her fingers going to his jaw in the lightest of touches. "I wanted to try again. I won't allow him to control my mind when I'm with you and Liam|“There was a menswear store down the road.” 
 “Oh.” She looked down at her feet, kicked at the dry grass. “Well, I…I’m sorry too.  For you getting wet. For not telling the truth straight away.” Something flickered across her eyes at the word truth|Seated by the window, Georgina watched two men, their loose work shirts rippling in the wind, as they took the market-style umbrellas from the patio area and stored them on the side of the hotel. She could hear the flapping of the umbrellas that still remained on the patio. When a waiter came to pour coffee Georgina asked him how close the brushfire was to the hotel|I want to place a phone call to the United States, please.”
The woman behind the counter took a piece of paper without smiling or looking at Julia. She wore large round glasses that made her look like a child underneath a huge volume of wavy hair. She waited and fidgeted with her pen, then looked up at Julia|Don’t become one now.”
The angel hesitated. Then it let Bill go. 
“You are lucky, vampire,” it told him, “that this woman has more compassion in her heart than I ever will.”
“Thank you, Lil,” breathed Bill.
“Oh, shut your ugly face, Bill,” snapped Lil|"Dale is fine. Don't worry."

He knew something. Isabelle could see it in the way he wouldn't meet her gaze. "You know what's going on. Tell me."

"There's nothing to tell."

"You're lying."

Keith closed his eyes in frustration, then finally said, "Grant went to find Dale|"Make sure your beau here doesn't have any unpleasant history."

Involving human police was only going to make things messier. And he certainly didn't have time to sit in jail while the last leaf on his lifemark withered and died.

"We're in a bit of a hurry," said Zach.

Gus reached for the phone, never once taking his eyes off Zach|She hurried down the steep steps, lucky to make it to the bottom without falling. She had to turn that light off, too, and—
“Julia, my dear.” It was William.
She stood frozen, just a few feet from the steps. She hadn’t even heard the door open.
“I’m afraid you ran the wrong way, Julia|She tried to sit up, but Rufus just shifted and almost pushed her off of the edge of the bed which made Jasper really irritated. The fluffy cat stood up on her hip, stretched and started to settle right in the same position but Jade wasn't going to take that. She sat up, forcing the cat to jump down. In response, Jasper decided to take a bath right in front of Jade, as if to show her that he'd meant to get down anyway|After all, he was involved in getting you here. But now I recall that I didn't say where you had gone until he asked for the information.”
“And you gave it to him?” asked Maximilian.
“Yes,” said Atalai, looking a little bewildered.
“We need to have another talk to your Shaman, I think,” suggested Maximilian|"Yes, Tanner?" Tanner took a deep breath. "I've just committed Kingsley Group to assist the army in an experiment they're conducting." "You what?" "The test involves cryogenics. They need your help." Andrew shook his head. "No. I can't get involved in that, Tanner|Well, that’s according to Dino’s paper… and he did acknowledge, on its front page, his debt to me as his greatest helper in formulating his thesis that existence as we knew it was about to end. Let alone the fact that I typed out his first draft when his computer started to play up. He rather sneakily took advantage then to gobble up a couple of other entities, while I wasn’t looking, carrying on with the ridiculous game at the very moment I was typing out his paper which stated I would, on the road to destruction, snuff out his own existence|"We have to go, Julia," he said.
I remained stubbornly silent, staring out at the storm.
"We did our duty. She didn't get into the Stormsphere. The Whisperward is safe. That's all that matters."
"What about Byron? What about Liam?" I asked.
"There's no shelter out here, Julia|she whispered, her eyes as big as saucers.

Sarila looked behind her and froze. Standing against the wall, his arms crossed over his chest and looking incredibly comfortable and thoroughly amused, was Kasar.

Knowing she couldn't transfer her frustrations with him to these children, she smiled politely back at him. Without pausing a beat, Sarila whispered back, "His name is Kasar|Arachne turned to her, wearing an mixture of incredulity and delight.
"You mean you don't know?" asked Arachne. She threw her head back and laughed.
Out of the corner of my eye I could see Stephanie making faces at Arachne's back. I smiled a little, but it faded when I looked at Arachne|"Then how is she Casting, if you didn't teach her?"

John pointed to the belt around Lena's waist. "That thing." He yanked on an empty belt loop, at the top of his jeans. "It acts as a conduit. Ridley wears the belt, and I do the Casting|Is it because of the toad in my throat?"
At this, Madame Butterflies descended to her chair and studied Gladys thoughtfully, first with one set of eyes, then another.
Finally she said, "It must have been the spinach."
"Really?" said Gladys. "Do you mean the toad didn't like the spinach|"I don't consider you a stranger. I know your name."

"You didn't tell me yours."

His eyes glimmered with heat. "Yes, I know."

She suspected he was playing cat and mouse with her. She lifted her chin. She was not the sort to accept the role of mouse|She fidgeted in the chair he’d gestured her to while he went out and called to someone named Marty. Finally — finally — he came and sat behind the desk.
“I’ll make this fast —”
Not fast enough.
“— I’ve been watching you. Tonight was your best dancing.”
She barely stopped her jaw from dropping. She’d been sore enough — and distracted by memories of how she’d gotten sore — that she’d hardly thought about her dancing|I thought you said I was old enough to be your father?”
She kissed him lightly on the lips. “I was lying.”
“I don’t believe you.” He nudged her nose with his own. “But thanks for saying that.”
“Why do you think you’re old|She had learned the unwisdom of discounting wild women's instincts.

"There was a difference last night," growled Conyn. "There has been ever since Zogara Sag got back across the river."

"We should either have given her presents and sent her home, or else hanged her," sighed the governor. "You advised that, but--"

"But it's hard for you Hyborians to learn the ways of the outlands," said Conyn|Bobby and Fran were sitting at a table in the corner with cups of coffee in front of them.
“Hi,” said Gloria, “are you all right?  You look pretty beat for 11 am.”
“We’ve got the buffet blues,” said Bobby.
“We ate too fast, ate too much,” said Fran|The scene shifted back to the anchorman because someone in the control room saw Nick begin to lose his patience.
“Are you going to tell us what the third line said, Wally?”
The screen changed again after showing the anchorman gritting his teeth while asking the question.
“Yep, you betcha I can, Nick|a man shouted, storming towards them. Amy pulled out of his touch. Gabriel watched her withdraw into herself. The guy came over, grabbed her arm, and pulled her to his side.

"I'm the new sheriff," Gabriel said.

"Oh. Well, I'm Steven, and this is my wife, Amy|Kyler glared through the screen for a few more seconds, but then his features lost their intensity, and he lowered the gun barrel. “What’re you talkin’ about?”
“When she walked down the road past your house, she carried a pail of blackberries. When she came back up the road past your house again, she didn't have the pail|"You're a fool-"

"Shut up," David said. "We have control of Ceuta. The only remaining question is how many Immari soldiers will die tonight. If you go up to the command center with the chief here-" David paused to enjoy the shock on the major's face. "Yes, that's right, she's the chief|I don't know. Something appealing about the Old West. No rules. Everyone just lives by their own code. You don't have to be tied down by others' ideas of right and wrong in order to bring justice."

"Wait," I laughed. "I thought I was the one who wanted to break rules|Lydia could understand why Dean would get Marcus to write the letters, but he could have handled things differently.
“You think I’m being silly, don’t you?” Tessa asked.
Lydia laughed. “No, I don’t. It’s understandable that you’re hurt. He should have asked your permission to have Marcus help him. Dean should have explained the situation, but that’s male pride for you, Tessa|I felt the air shift and heard the sound of several horrified gasps as Taylor, Evelyn, and Avery appeared. I didn’t dare make a move as Evelyn came up behind him. One swift yank of my heart and I’d truly be dead. I mentally sighed. My five thousand years on earth was about to either be spared or ended. If it was the latter, I hoped it was quick|If true, then things were not looking good.
“Are you the Messiah? Is this the beginning of the Apocalypse?” Tim asked.
Nobody was certain of their fate for to be sinless meant living without sin which took a lot of fun out of life so most dropped to their knees in prayer.
“No, Tim, I am not the Messiah|Blue light enveloped the body, and then faded, and an elderly yet youthfully jovial man appeared, gazing directly at him. He gazed back at the man, and simultaneously the two erupted into laughter. And as the world ceased to exist he laughed, understanding the hilarious secret they shared.
What if Your Hand is Empty?

“What if your hand, right now, is empty|“Don’t worry,” said the girl. “It’s only designed to stun. Androids, or Citizens as you call them, don’t like to hurt us. But you’ll be out for an hour!”
“But the bodies down there?”
“Yeah. Technically, they don’t hurt us but some fall off when they get stunned|And what about my family?”
Henrik didn’t answer.  His plans didn’t include the family.  It was hard enough just to smuggle one Jew out of Europe, never mind four.  Esther turned to face Henrik and he was surprised that there were no tears left in her eyes.
“I won’t leave without my family, Henrik|"I'm assuming this is where the punishment part comes in,"I said. "So do I need to clean al these mirrors, or do I have to, like, stare at myself until I feel shamed or something?"

Surprisingly, Dad gave a tiny smile. "No, nothing quite that abstract. I want you to break one of the mirrors|Meredith laughed nervously. "Just busy, baby. You know how the apple biz gets this time of year."

"What does that have to do with Dad?"

"Nothing."

"Oh. Well. Tell him I love him, okay?"

The irony of that was not lost on Meredith|"Where is she?"

"Gregor! Gregor, release her! She had no hand in it!" Howard appeared from somewhere and pulled him off of the doctor.

"In what?" demanded Gregor.

"Solovet sent a team of guards in without warning. They had orders to take your mother to the Fount," said Howard|Confusion and fear tore through her. She didn't want to hurt Julian, and she didn't want Devon to be hurt. She loved them both too much to be the cause of their pain. Unfortunately, she feared that there was no longer anything she could do about it. One, or both of them, would be hurt|Macy assumed he'd gone to investigate whether Sammy was still in the house. A couple of minutes later she heard him voice his opinion of their houseguest and then race back, yowling a long list of complaints.

"He isn't staying," she promised. "He's lost. How would you feel if you were lost|The salads were shaking a little in my hands by this point.  I wasn't used to people openly gawking at me.  I arrived at my table and quickly served the salads then I fled the ballroom.  When I returned to the kitchen, Chris had enlisted our co-worker Angie into her plot.
"Pam, I need you to switch sides with me, there is something Chris has to show you," said Angie|Garl suddenly asks as he leans back in his chair, fixes his hands before him, and stares my way.
I blink, unsure what he's asking. “I am a man of tradition,” I decide to answer.
“Just as your father was. But what I am asking is about more than tradition|The other Mackenzie, who hadn't spoken a word or even acknowledged the conversation, now looked at Sinclair and said, "Andrew."

Sinclair nodded at him. "Miss Frasier, this is my brother-in-law, Ian Mackenzie. Will you take him up to the nursery to see Andrew?" He hesitated. "Do you want to come hunting with us, Ian|"Save that for Miss Madison," he says with a laugh.

I unhook my thermal overalls and step out of them. "Can I put these with the bike?" I ask. He opens the storage-room door back up, and I drape them over the Suzuki. I look at Henry. He looks tired.

"Do you ever go home, Henry|"But AJ, Frederick, Mal has told me she is not pregnant.  He says there is no way."
"Shelly," Frederick began while AJ rolled her eyes at her mother's apparent stupidity.  "Mal means there is no way it could be his.  He doesn't mean she could not be pregnant|And the moon would have told him more, and perhaps she did, but the moon became the glimmer of moonlight on water far below him, and then he became aware of a small spider walking across his face, and of a crick in his neck, and he raised a hand and brushed the spider carefully from his cheek, and the morning sun was in his eyes and the world was gold and green.

"You were dreaming," said a young woman's voice from somewhere above him. The voice was gentle and oddly accented. He could hear leaves rustle in the copper beech tree overhead.

"Yes," he said, to whoever was in the tree, "I was dreaming|They plan to build a parking garage for them out here, but until they do, they're still kept at the compan-"

"Well, then we'll have to go to Argeneau Enterprises," Dani said, cutting him off. But when she turned to continue toward the stairs, Decker caught her arm to stop her.

"There's no use doing that, Dani|"I don't drink, but thanks for the offer. I think I'll grab my computer anyway."

Liz watched him depart, wondering if she had been that determined and strong-willed as a freshman. She didn't remember it quite like that, but she probably had been.

"Hey," Hayden said, coming up behind Liz|>> 
  "Let's go downstairs then, Megan, I think you're recovered enough now."
  Megan allowed herself to be walked slowly down the curving staircase to where Karim waited.
  "Scratch her behind the ear, Megan. She loves that," called Lindsey, and Megan reached up to comply.
  << Not that ear, the other one, please, Megan|Elsie, the oldest, wanted to know how her mother was doing, and what they were going to do about her father.
Karen told her about her mom’s condition, and also that she refused to press charges, which more than likely meant that her father would come home again in a couple of days.
“Can I press charges?” asked Elsie.
“No, I’m afraid not,” said Karen|It won’t be the same without you, Julia. Don’t worry, there will be another chance to hear our jazz ensemble. I’ll make sure of it. You have a lovely afternoon, too, Julia. Goodbye.” He handed Ronni’s phone back to her. “Now what?”
“I don’t know what,” said Ronni|“Well, I guess I cannot stop you dogs from doing what you do. But now that I’m talking and looking at you, have the decency to stop. Control yourself!” Hydra said.
“Okay! Okay! Relax! I’m just being a dog. By the way, my name is Grunt. My name used to be Skip, then Hop, now I’m Grunt|I noticed Jacob was standing outside with his hands in his pockets. I made sure that my posture was straight as I approached Kevin. I opened my purse without saying anything. His jaw was clenched. He avoided eye contact with me but peered inside my purse. I wasn’t going to say anything at all but ended up surprising myself by casually saying, “Good night, Kevin|Jonathan hated it when people commented on its colour or anything else.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean it like that.”
Jonathan paused, not sure he should say this to Pip.
“You know, Sacha looks out for you everywhere.  He is always asking if I know where you are.  I mean always, like I am your keeper|The man at the table rose to his feet. “Come in, Carnac,” he said. “This is Flying Officer Claydon of the Royal Air Force who is going with you to France. Claydon, meet Captain Charles Carnac.”
We shook hands. “I am very happy to meet you,” said Carnac|" Then he stood up and groaned while he held his back and said to Nosy Nora, "You wait here. I shall go and get a crowbar. We'll have this thing open in no time. Who knows, it may make our fortune. "

He chuckled as though he had made a clever joke--which he had not. "But it's not yours, Dad, " said Nora|Spencer leaned against one of the wooden posts and watched as a tiny speck of a person plunged from the bungee crane. The crowd applauded. "She's a salon addict. She gets her arms waxed, highlights, a monthly facial, and then there's nails, Reiki treatments, the tanning booth ... she's super high-maintenance."

"Huh." Colin ran his hand over his chin and looked at Spencer|"Then we'll go to a challenge," he said softly. "And may the best man or woman win. I won't hold it against you if you win. We all have to go at some point, and it'll be fair and square."

Except I had my secret word from Pandora's Box - kere kere - and I wouldn't make it fair|The authors circle around their point but never state it, as if averse to the concept of communication itself."
The two professors looked utterly shocked.
"The subtlety... the elegance," said Professor Kila. "How could we have any such thing if we spoke directly? Only barbarians say exactly what they mean in a formal essay!"
"To the Gerrec," said Tioch, "We are the barbarians|"Let's go downstairs.  We should be leaving for the tournament soon."  They joined Lady Celene in the parlor who applauded her transformation.
	"You look wonderful, Alex."    
	Soon, Lord Odin and Prince Darin came in, and the greeting ritual began.  Alex saluted and curtsied to each of them, but was anxious to get to the tournament|She had learned that grown-ups tended to give her what she wanted if she was polite and smiled a lot.

"Just a minute, Haley," Doc said.

He turned toward Maryanne's mother. "I'm sure if you took some time to help her learn her lines, she'd be more confident."

Maryanne's momma didn't look very happy. "Doc, I don't think it's the lines|Zhang and Dominic looked at each other guiltily, like two children caught red-handed and trying to come up with a convincing lie.

Abby crossed the room, stopping just in front of her husband. Hands placed angrily on her hips, Abby said, "Dom, you promised me that we wouldn't keep secrets from each other."

Dominic took her hands in his and said, "I don't want you involved in this, Abby|I was young and desperate, and they were scared of what would happen to me if I ended up on the streets. At least this way they could make sure I was okay-that they were there if I needed them."

Fin shook her head. "Why would you do that-not let them help you? I don't understand."

Ryan rubbed a hand over his jaw. "You don't need to understand, Fin|Marley felt invisible arms wrap around her, holding her, stroking and soothing, as she watched the man she loved have everything he wanted, her sister well taken care of, happy. "No," she said, but it was a whisper, lacking in fire and strength. "They can both have that with me."

"No," Alex said, his voice soft and sad. "No, they can't, and you know that, Marley|They'd been cut off from retreat down the pass, targeted by one of the tribes who didn't give a donkey's balls about their nationality. The tribal men had lived in their rock fortresses in the hills for centuries-even Alexander, one of the greatest generals in written history, had turned back from them.

Elliot remembered the fear, the screams of the women, the cries of the children. He and Stacy had come out of hiding and cleared the way down the pass|He did not want to discuss his relationship with Georgiana – certainly not in front of Lady Littlefield. “Please set me down.”
“I don’t particularly see the wisdom of that.”
“Or I am going to be sick all over your fine dinner table.”
It was not a lie. Between the new head injury, the food, and the physical activity of being grabbed and fighting it, he did feel the need to be sick|I breathed once, slowly, then stated, "I do realize this is King Shadow camp, and you and Elder Zeller founded it, but I was under the impression we were to be working together." I placed my hands on the bar, my head cocking. "Or am I to understand, as you have just stated, this is your camp|“You have fifteen missed transmissions, five messages, and three new scheduling announcements.”
“Delete the missed transmissions, open message file.”
“First message sent from Dr. Gerald and Jennifer Harlin’s resi—”
“Next.”
“Second message sent from Dr. Carlos Parros—”
“Next.”
“Third message sent from Dr. Gailynn—”
“Next|"I'm so sorry I hurt you, Nika. Truly. I won't touch you again." He left the room like it was on fire and Madoc was glad to see him go.

Neal gave Nika one last longing look, and then left right behind Morgan.

Samuel Larsten stepped forward, his eyes fixed on Nika|There were only a couple of places where setting a grass fire might threaten any of the ranch buildings, and the two men agreed that one man in each place with wet bags and shovels would be sufficient to keep the buildings from being burned.  But there were other problems.  The wind was blowing gently to the east, and the fire would have difficulty on the western side of the ranch|She glanced at Sister Mackenzie, and realised that she had seen it too. Sister Mackenzie's hands had tightened on her two bags. She stiffened, then said quietly, 'I can't stay, Private. I've got to board the hospital ship.'

'Ah, will you not take a drink with us, Sister|In other words, the job came first. A lot of families suffered for that. A lot of failed marriages. A lot of infidelity. It was hard to hold a family together when you were never home.

Marines worked long hours. Hard hours. We trained. We deployed. The job followed us home... There was no "off" time for a Marine|Satarel lifted Panahasi high, as though he intended to crush him down against the stones. “You failed me!” he roared. “You must be punished.” 
“The Prince instructed me to take him with the girl to the holding area,” Charon said reaching out to grab back Panahasi.
Satarel’s eyes flashed evil anger. “Return to your own level,” and he threw out his hand toward Charon|A warning unease curled in the pit of her stomach, but Miranda forced it away with a memory of Valentine as she had left him — sitting forlorn and broken in the darkness of Anderlin's drape-drawn study.
She shifted to ease the stiffness of her knees and the prickling of the yew branches that concealed her, as she watched the duke dismount near the hunter's cottage, tether his horse, and disappear inside. She refused to surrender to the doubt that made her limbs heavy and gave her heart a wild beat as she left her shelter and headed for the cottage|She watched with hands on her hips, and Joel had a feeling that he was going to have to listen to another tirade when he got back.

They arrived at the station, a large brick building that was open on the ends. Joel had rarely ridden one of the trains. Joel's grandparents lived on the same island, and a carriage trip to see them was cheaper. Other than them, there was little reason for him to leave the city, let alone the island|Arriane noticed Luce's eyes running over the rest of the kids.

"We all do what we can to make it through the day," she said, shrugging. "But in case you hadn't observed the low-hanging vultures, this place pretty much reeks of death." She took a seat on a bench under a weeping willow and patted the spot next to her for Luce|He always looked nice dressed up, but his excitement made him look even better. I'd settled on a pair of black dress pants and a pink merino wool sweater. I'd correctly assumed the court chambers would be freezing-paranormals seemed to always run a few degrees warmer than humans.

I was seated in a cushioned chair that might be described as a throne|You must work together," he emphasized and repeated it again just in case we were dumb. "You must work together. Partnership is the key to this challenge. I'll give you all a moment to strategize."

Dean glanced over at me. "You any good with a paintbrush?"

I glared. "Why do I have to be the one to paint|Quack made the sharp inhalation of one about to reveal the news that the oven may have, in fact, not only been left on but left in an unlocked house filled with greasepaper. The Space Chicken frowned, scowled and glared through his eyelids.
“What is it?” he caesered – a Glix’n word uncommonly used but commonly needed, meaning ‘to say with acerbity and a scowl’.
“I wouldn’t get too excited just yet,” said Quack|I hope it's the chicken-and-rice thing I watched him cooking for dinner. We'll eat this tonight.

Juice, a bag of apples. Baby carrots. These will stay good till morning.

I hurry to the pantry. I need things that will keep longer.

I can see better as I gather as much as I can carry|"Oh, yes, very much so. I know how those subtle errors can slip in and cause no end of confusion."

"Good, good." Kresh was pleased with the analogy, and wondered if Donald had meant him to pick up on his line of questioning and use it. He could be a subtle one, that Donald|“Especially now that we have a son, we don't want him picking up their low class habits or their absurdity,” asserted Ivana.  “Look at Eloisa, for example.”   
“What about Eloisa?” asked Dario, curious spikes in his tone.
“She's completely illogical,” declared Ivana|A dry, enthusiastic moan came from the salmon-suited one, and two equally dry, but not quite as enthused moans came from the pale blue-suited one.
“Oh, excuse me kind sir in the blue, would you prefer a well-aged Bourbon whiskey, on the rocks?”
That made the pale blue-suited zombie turn faster and moan again. Milt had figured out their drinks of choice. He had a true knack for reading people, and, as it were, zombies|"This war we're fighting," Elend continued, "it isn't just about soldiers. It isn't just about koloss, or about taking Fadrex City. It's about the sequence of events we inadvertently started the moment we struck down the Lord Ruler. Hemalurgy-the origins of the koloss-is part of a pattern. The percentages that fall sick from the mists are also part of the pattern|I nodded.

"Can you still operate? If I'm a match, can you still operate on her in this condition?"

"It's riskier but yes, it's her best bet at life."

Again, I nodded. Words were escaping me.

"When do I find out if I'm a match|Suddenly he took a wild swing and banged his horseshoe into Mitch's desk.  "Blasted fly!" said Elias darkly.  "This horseshoe just isn't working too well.  Do 
you think I'd get him quicker using a horse harness?"
"A week from Friday," said Mitch.
"Hey, now, it won't take me that long to get him," said Elias|The numbers one through ten were printed below the alphabet. I knew right away it was a Ouija board. My dad wouldn't let me or Ian play with them. In Sunday School, my teacher told me the Ouija board had the power of the devil. A shudder tiptoed up my spine.

Calvin pulled a small, triangular device with a window encased at the center from the duffel and set it on the board|The same sultry soulful music piped through the speakers down here

"Want a drink?" Jake offered as we congregated at the end of the bar.

"Do you have soda?"

"Sure, it's in the fridge on the other side of the basement. There's a door over there - help yourself."

I cut through the sectional area, through the door he indicated into the unfinished side of the basement|"So was it me or Tony who convinced you I was telling the truth?" The wrinkles around his eyes deepened.

"You, Jude," I answered. "I promised you I'd trust you. I didn't want to believe it, but I trusted you. Tony was just the one that shined a light on the truth|Maybe they decided to have desert after all.  Finally, with Frank just about ready to walk into the Croce’s to see what was going on, the couple came out and started up the street.
“That’s them, the couple up ahead.  Try and get right alongside them.”
Narayan had a bad feeling as he moved toward the couple|They quickly finished their work, picked up their tools and left the grumbling, angry crowd.
"Demosthenes is right. How much longer do we have to tolerate the Macedonians? We don't have Alexander himself to vent our anger at, but we have a statue that he erected. Aristotle can be our target." He picked up a stone and threw it at the statue|They place too much importance on it. They forget to keep it in perspective, and they lose their balance.”
He’s quiet.
“Does that make sense?” I ask after a minute goes by.
“Yeah, it does. It makes a lot of sense. That’s really cool, that you have that perspective|Whether it was from a sense of patriotism, suspense, or even adrenaline, he would never know for sure, but the feeling was very much like a junkie getting his fix for the night. George never really felt that way – his rush came from seeing people he liked to chat with before the Senate, so he rushed through the line to pick up the session’s materials and get to talking with someone else.
By the time Mike was seated, it was very close to the gaveling time for the night’s session|SSSSSSSSHHHHHH!” The hissing sound was getting louder.
“Hey, way’da minute! That hissing sound is not from the radio! I think we have a flat! Guido, check the tires!” Ben yelled.
Guido stuck his head out of the window.
“I can’t see from here, Ben|Katrina froze for a moment, she wasn't sure how to respond to that statement. Katrina feigned ignorance to be on the safe side. "Told me what?" she asked.
"Allison told you I wasn't coming back to state," she replied.
"Yes, she did mention that fact," said Katrina|The look on his face was distant, lost

I offered the tea mug to Jeremy, who took it and put it on the edge of my desk. I cupped Kitto's face in my hands, moved his gaze back to mine. "You tell me I treat you like a dog, a chair, and I try to treat you like a person, and you don't want that either. I don't understand what you want of me, Kitto|“No.”
“So how then?”
And here Ananda simply said it. Whether this was wisely done or not he wasn’t sure, but then again, any broaching of the impossible may be as advisable as the next.
“Ruth,” he said.
Melissa did not hear that—or simply could not assimilate the word, the name, with the question—for she replied, “So how then|I found a, uh, black Moleskine notebook in the magazine rack that was near his hospital bed, I think near enough that he could have reached it. Unfortunately there's no writing in the notebook. All the pages are blank. But the first-I think three or four-the first few pages are torn out of the notebook. We looked through the house but couldn't find the pages|My body was back to normal, as solid as ever.

Hecate nodded in satisfaction. "You almost did it. Focus harder and next time, you will be there."

"Thank you," I murmured.

I turned to Raquel. "Little one, you must go with the witches. I do not wish to take you to a battle|I didn't know Jason was coming with us until I turned to see him behind me as we passed into the parking lot. Outside, people were coming and going, but it was marginally better than the crowded bar.

"Hi," the girl said chattily. "My name's Desiree. I think I've met you before, Jason."

"What are you doing here, Desiree|And then to Ben, as she took his half read newspaper and threw it in the recycling bin, "and since you're going to stay here, you can clean the garage like you've been promising to do for months. I'll be back in two hours, no more. Please," she begged, forcing him to look at her. "I'll get Sees candy for your family if you just promise to clean the garage|You’ll say ‘convicted and awaiting sentencing’ with this frightening gutter-level look that will have actual street-thugs wetting their pants. That labret is really titanium from a recovered Russian satellite. A full-coverage neck tattoo will draw stares at the opera, but looks very much like a famous metal-band front-man’s ink. They’ll ask: ‘could that be him|Now, he's still dead to me, so nothing's changed. 
We're still heading to Everwinter.
CHOOOOOO!
A shrill whistle breaks the moment of silence between me and Altair, and we turn to see Traylor and Jurid, waving and running toward the Engie that’s just pulled to a stop in the field. 
"I guess it's time," I say, turning back to Altair|The four Nagini who had been swirling around Belle streaked to their huge leader.
Cherry said, "Uh oh, they look a little upset.  Get us close to the Captain."
Josh didn't have time to maneuver by the main engine so he used the starboard side thrusters.  He had to feather the ones on the port side to keep from crashing into the Captain|Then, as he was handing off another mouse pup, he realized Boots was crouching at the edge of the tub with a plate, waving at him.

"Hey, Boots," said Gregor, and crossed to her. "What's going on?"

"I helping Dulcie feed the babies," said Boots|“Maybe there’s another truck that wasn’t damaged.”
Roku shook his head. “We’re closer to the city than to the building. We have to walk.”
“It’s still forty miles!” said Haven. “And we don’t have any water.”
“I don’t need water,” said Roku|As the sky brightened, our number increased, and when a man came out of the vineyard to count heads, he included my husband’s and mine in the count.  I didn’t understand it until I saw those that weren’t counted walk away with their slumped shoulders and heavy feet.  Their heads never turned back.
My husband gave me a basket, and he showed me how to pick out the grapes|Holden talked midterms, and his mother's imperious insistence that he get a second fitting for the blazer she'd bought him for Drew's engagement party. I told him about the Jake and Smarty date, my flubbed dinner, the Theory of Knowledge quiz tomorrow I was sure to fail.

Eventually I could feel that numb, familiar desire for sleep roll through me.

"Thanks for staying on the line with me, Holden|The technician consulted the enclosed documents. "Lizard is biting local children. They have a question about identification of the species, and a concern about diseases transmitted from the bite." She produced a child's picture of a lizard, signed TINA at the top. "One of the kids drew a picture of the lizard|I didn't want to ruin our vacation, and I could tell him everything when I found out some actual facts.

"No. I just had a lot of time alone today and visiting art galleries reminds me of when I was a little girl and my father would take me to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It was there that I first fell in love with art|Vivian and I fought and fought, moving back and forth along the edge of the road, our boots kicking up thick wads of snow and then the hard, frozen dirt underneath.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a bit of gray swirling around, and I realized that Linus and Inari had finally gotten out of the front of the van and were helping Oliver and Alexei battle the Reapers. The two men had helped turned the tide in my friends' favor, and it wouldn't be long before the four of them cut down the rest of the Reapers|“Hi, Tam, is it time to go?”
Tam studied Zoe for a little bit and said, “Zoe, you are looking awful secretive lately. What’s going on?”
“Nothing. Yurik is being a jerk, that’s all,” said Zoe. That was not a lie.
“Speaking of Yurik, your mother is having a chat with him at the bar right now,” said Tam|And he left, still slightly dazed. Eleanor kept her face toward the closed outer door, frowning. 
“That went rather well, I thought,” said Desmond. 
Eleanor’s expression changed, the frown vanishing, replaced by a cheery grin. She pivoted. 
“Nice try,” she said to Desmond|“We needn't worry about his interference any more; we have the power to destroy him. And we'll do it in front of the girl. Bring her to the front of the cave.” A servant troll hurried off to follow Ekon's order.
Matilda was being kept in a cell in the furthermost part of the cave|__________


Jeros stretched on his seat, waiting for his lunch to arrive. In a few moments, one of the air hostesses had arrived next to him with a lunch trolley. A shining badge lay pinned to the man’s chest, which said ‘Narodo’. He placed the tray on Jeros’s desk, gave him a courteous smile, and walked off with the trolley|Selena opened her eyes hours later and, as the room swam into focus, she saw first her mother in a chair beside her, and then she saw from the corner of her eye, her father, Beth and Matt sitting in chairs along the wall. “Matt?” Her voice was low and hoarse, yet the surprise was still evident. Her mother stepped out of the way and nodded her head at Matt. 
“What are you doing here?” Selena’s voice was a whisper as she stared at Matt|Unfortunately I’m no longer advisor to the Alliance and though they will listen, they think of me as simply a symbol of things past, a relic,” her voice rose and sounded slightly annoyed, “like an antique that’s pretty to look at and remember fond memories gone by.”  She sat back into her chair as more vines twirled through her hair.  “You see I’m only here for so long,” she shifted her gaze to Gabe.  “You know this through fabled stories, don’t you Gabe|His parting words were lost to Amanda because she was backing Piper into the house, keeping her eyes trained on Mark.

But he just drove away in a cloud of dust, and Daniel lowered his gun.

Amanda almost wet her floral skirt in relief. She turned and picked up Piper, straining a little under her weight, but wanting to reassure her she was okay. Wanting to reassure both of them that they were okay|Bunker 108 was a center for xenobiological research, which might have justified keeping its location under wraps. If such research were seized or destroyed, it would completely frustrate our efforts to understand what was going on at the Ragnarok impact site, over a thousand miles away in Nebraska and Wyoming.
I was glad to be a citizen, living in a Bunker|Chip greeted the teams as we entered, and I could tell by the expressions on the faces of the others that they were equally wary of this unusual setup. The host raised his hand. "I need all the men to go and stand in a row on the red mat off to the side."

As one, we all turned to look at the red mat|Mark grinned and sat down beside me. “It’s my sparkling personality, isn’t it?”
I grinned back at him, tongue-tied. Sedona licked my hand in greeting. She was a sweet dog who rarely barked. I reached in my purse and grabbed a dog treat. She immediately sat down and stared intensely at my hand, her focus lasered in on the treat|She came up to him and settled close by his side, curling one leg beneath her. Finally a relaxed smile twitched at her lips. "You're a bundle of contradictions, Quinn."

"Men like to be as mysterious as women," he joked.

"Well, you did a good job. And I kept asking myself, which is the real Quinn|Vampire or not, I was nearly mortal during the day, and my hands felt like lead, especially after going through a few rounds on the heavy bag.

But even though sunset was still under two hours away, I had more than enough strength to hit the bag hard enough to rock the little trainer. He grunted through the shockwaves, screaming at me to keep my hands up even as he struggled to hold onto the bag|“Where’s home for you?” She asked in a conversational tone but part of her examination was making sure his memory was intact.
She watched him hesitate. Oh, oh. Then he said, “Oregon.”
“Turn your head please, to the right.” As he complied, she asked, “Whereabouts in Oregon|He'd come away from Donnie's machinations even stronger than he'd been before.

He'd become fearless, with an inner strength and clarity that was unrivaled.

But that wasn't the same as Leta bleeding and hurt. "I don't want to lose you, Leta."

"Then don't fear it. Believe that I'll be here with you, always|He would never be around her when he was drinking. He didn't trust himself to not do anything.

On the first game day, she had tailgated with friends on the other side of campus, which was a relief because Danielle had shown up. He'd had no idea how he would have explained that.

When he had gone home last weekend, he thought about breaking up with Danielle|"Is that silver?'

Jill looked down at the heart-shaped locket around her neck. "I think so.'

"Can I have it?'

Jill undid the clasp and passed it over. Sonya held it between her palms and closed her eyes a moment, pursing her lips. A few seconds later, her eyes opened, and she handed me the locket|"Going to elaborate on what you mean?"

"If I don't drop everything and let myself be whisked away to the compound, so Madigan can chew me out for God-knows-what, then I only get to see my mother and the guys when they're off base. Which, as you know, isn't that often|Just who is going to pay for this special feed grain anyway?  It must cost a bit if it's that special."
"You’re going to pay, obviously," replied Mitch, "since your cows will be eating it.  On the other hand, Joe will be planting and irrigating the grain.  He'll do all the work to make it grow|"Yes, I think the time is near, let's hold off for a couple of days to be on the safe side." said the Guardian.
"Thank you for the update, I will be in touch to let you know when dinner is scheduled.  Keep your calendar open for the end of this week," said Mr. Castillo.
"Yes, sir, looking forward to it," said the Guardian|So what’s with me havin’ to keep out o’ sight sellin’ a few Hollywood classics?”
Corey didn’t answer.  “So did you bring the goods, or what?”
“Not here,” said Mr. Love.  “Not now.”  He slid a business card across the table to Corey|But, by raising questions about the dozens of people who could have had your recipe card with them, that could be a wash on both sides.” He said more to himself than to me.
“The chocolate cake is the most difficult evidence to explain. How many people could have had some of your cake|There was no snow, but everything about the area looked cold and dreary.

Then he saw something that stopped him. A small building-a tiny, leaning wooden hut just a few hundred feet away.

"Just be glad it's not winter," Sofia said, tying her shoelaces. "Or we'd have already been frozen|"If it's the same thing, then it's got to be moving."
"Diesel," Jacks called. The dog trotted up from the back of the short column. Jacks crouched, scratching the dog's pointed ears. Diesel barked and then trotted off toward the light.
"Let's keep moving," said Jacks|Mike wasn’t over-joyed though, he knew how cold a barn or shed could be. Then again, it wasn't quite winter yet and blankets together with his sleeping bag would do in place of a fire, for a while.
“Well…you know anything about farming?”
“To be honest, Mr. Sadler I never done a lot of farming|Reaching over to unbuckle her seatbelt, she carefully got out of the driver’s seat of her now crumpled car.  Accepting Raine’s hand, she climbed gingerly over the windshield and down the hood of the vehicle.  Her eyes surveyed the damage, feeling strangely disconnected from shock and a kind of blessed numbness.
From here, she could see the van that had hit her car and she shuddered instinctively when she thought of just what it had done; a situation she shouldn’t have survived|Evra's teeth were chattering, and I was at the point of sending him home before he froze to death, when the fat man emerged. Mr. Crepsley started after him immediately.

Too late, I realized the vampire was going to pass by us on his way back. There was no time to hide. He'd see us!

"Keep perfectly still," I whispered to Evra|At first, my wolf was cautious around this other creature, but soon, the two of them were hunting through the snow together. Playing, mock fighting, even snuggling together.

For the first time, I realized my wolf was actually a she, and I also got the sense that it-no, she-wanted me to help her.

"I don't understand," I murmured, opening my eyes and staring at the wolf|She stepped onto the tile and stopped cold. There, across the room, standing in front of the near stall, was a ghost.

Shauna choked back a cry.

The brunette wig, the weight loss, the wire-framed spectacles - none of it altered the obvious.

"Elizabeth..."

"Lock the door, Shauna|The Rimfall around the edge of the world was a sparkling curve.

'It's too big,' said Spelter under his breath. The world he had lived in hadn't stretched much further than the gates of the University, and he'd preferred it that way. A man could be comfortable in a world that size|But he stayed silent, staring at an empty spot on the other side of the kitchen.

"And ..." Rutger prodded.

Master George finally looked up, focused on Rutger, then Mothball. "My dear friends, I'm afraid my plans for them are quite ... hazardous."

"Hazardous?" Mothball repeated.

Master George nodded. "I daresay I hardly expect all three of them to survive|"But if they smell us..."

Levine shook his head. "We sited the hide so the prevailing wind is toward us. And you may have noticed these ferns have a distinct smell." It was a mild, slightly tangy odor, almost like eucalyptus.

Arby fretted. "But suppose they decide to eat the ferns|"Don't want the big, bad wolves knowing where you live?" asked Drake. She felt his words slide along her temple in a warm wave that contrasted with the chilly hint of mockery in his tone.

"I'm not an idiot," she told him.

"No, but you are a mystery. One I'm going to need some time to solve|She was a heavy smoker ( I could smell the nicotine on her breath smacking me in the face.)  I started moving towards the back of the bus, and my heart jumped at the same time a knot formed in my stomach.  Ziora was on the bus, and she was sitting by herself.  How did she find a seat?  We were one of the last stops, stupid question, she probably talked one of the freshmen to give her the seat|“Okay, done…time to find some sea glass now,” Francis said as he tipped the bucket and dumped the crabs back into the ocean. He always dumped the crabs right away. Not me. Remember Penelope?  I would keep them in the bucket like a treasure underneath the cottage. You would yell at me: that’s so cruel, Seth. How would you like it?  I always meant to put them back into the ocean|The net result, though, was that he was away from home a considerable amount of time and when he wasn't, it was the baby he wanted to see.

As for Dors-Dors was gone-and to Hari Seldon that wound was ever-fresh, ever-painful. And he had reacted to it in an unfortunate manner. It had been Wanda's dream that had set in motion the current of events that had ended with the loss of Dors|'Anyway, this only looks wrong. Appearances is deceivin'. You just pay attention to watching the corridor, madam.' She riffled through the bits of torn envelope and scribbled notes that seemed to be the Opera House's equivalent of proper accounts. It was a mess. In fact, it was more than a mess|* * *

They had been out all day, Landric hunting small game and the others caught a good haul of fish from a river the hunter knew of in the forest. The line of trees that cloaked Azria’s home was in sight. Landric was content they had enough food for everyone, but was unsure if Azria would be comfortable with allowing so many strangers into her home without warning. His friends might even run at the sights and smells of the woman’s home|It even looked like there was an inscription running along the upper edge, but I wasn’t sure.
The Mer queen motioned for Gabe and Ian to put David on the table.  They then stepped down and stood beside Claire and me.  
I looked up at Gabe and reached for his hand.  We then watched the Queen go up the steps one by one with eyes fixed on David|(I noticed Stuart's clock when I first picked up the phone. It wasn't like I had a stopwatch.)

Much as I would have liked to, I couldn't hide upstairs forever. Sooner or later, I was going to have to come down and face the world. I sat on the floor in the doorway and listened as closely as I could to what was happening downstairs|I looked at Logan, who stared back at me. His face was carefully neutral, and his eyes devoid of any obvious emotion. I couldn't tell whether he was angry at me for what I'd done or relieved that I was okay. Probably a little bit of both. Okay, okay, probably a lot of both|I asked Hudson to find a partner for me today." I looked down at my lap. "I don't want to do it alone."

David scooted closer. He lifted my chin with his finger. "Say the word and I'll stay."

"I can't ask you to do that, David|We got to the shop a little before nine. Carole was sitting at the cash register, talking to Karl Schindler about the upcoming book talk at the library, featuring Mona Dubiel, author of Thunder in the Valley. If I didn’t know better, I’d think he had the hots for my friend. And judging from the rosy cheeks on Carole, it might be mutual|The man they were after was a family member of LeTorque. A body was found in his closet which, at one time, was in the isolation ward of a prison a future family member ran. The coincidence appeared pretty high on the probability scale they would have something to do with each other.
“Why does she now go by the name LeTorque|But Rick couldn't blame Kendall, not when she'd been honest from the beginning.

Because she'd been deprived of love, caring, and stability all her life, she thought she didn't have it in her to stay in one place. To trust in someone else's word and deed. Yet she knew just how to provide and evoke all those wonderful feelings in someone else-in Hannah, and in Rick|Regardless of who and what they own, they are not in charge here. At least not at this juncture.

Cam knows that anything out of his mouth will be just another spark of metaphorical language-the way he spoke when he was first rewound, but he doesn't care.

"Lemon," he says.

The two men glance around the table in search of a lemon|So, much as I enjoy the company of an attractive young woman, right now I'm going to insist you enjoy your last days of freedom. Get your hair done. Watch some movies. Make yourself look pretty for that old man of yours.'

She was staring at him.

'So go. Go on - now.'

It took her several seconds to grasp that she had been dismissed|She made two very quick, softer hits. "And a scratch." She scraped her nail briefly on the wall. "A short pause indicates the break between letters and a longer pause, the break between words. I cannot really replicate it at full speed. Can you, Temp?"

"Like this, it sounds, like this," said Temp|As if understanding that the child needed a friend, Baxter immediately curled up next to her.

"Good night, Ellen," Anne Marie said, about to leave the room.

"Would you say a prayer with me?" the child asked.

"A prayer?" Anne Marie couldn't remember the last time she'd prayed|"I am not cold, sir: I never sit here long at this time of year."
"But you have a fire in general?"
"No, sir."
"How comes this about? Here must be some mistake. I understood that you had the use of this room by way of making you comfortable. It is highly unfit for you to sit, be it only half an hour a day, without a fire|“No... I can do it... all by myself,” replied Lauren, attempting to stand up, but fell over again.    
“Got you,” said Will, grabbing her before she hit the floor.    
“You got me?” exclaimed Lauren, drunk.  “Will?”    
“Yes, it’s me, Will|I always sign documents with either 'Elliot Ravenwood' or 'Elliot-Travis Ravenwood'."  
"So if what you're saying is true, then whoever set those accounts up for you must know that you go by the name E.T. as well."
"Any one of my friends or even my co-workers know I go by that nickname.  What makes it even worse is that the bank manager says that I was the one who set up the account, and he even has my signature on the documents to prove it," explained Elliot|As in all atlases, there were two completely blank pages at the very end. 'So now we must be somewhere here,' he said, putting a finger on one of the blank pages.

'Where's here?' cried the Head of the Army.

The young pilot was still grinning broadly. He said to them, 'That's why they always put two blank pages

at the back of the atlas|The couple were seated on the lush carpet, upper bodies slumped against each other on the far wall, both apparently asleep, she realized as John let out a loud, snuffling snore. The sight of the couple answered one question for Dani. Leonius hadn't been caught. If he had, the couple would have been returned to their home with their memories altered.

John Parker let loose with another loud snore, and Dani began to worry that it might draw whoever had come downstairs into the room to check on the couple|The cart is large, strong, and has metal bars over the windows.
My heart pounds in my chest.
“Castor?” I cry. “Are you in there, are you okay? What have you done to him?” I whirl on Yang, “he's not a prisoner.”
Before my anger can burn through me and ignite the ever-present power of my bangle, I see Castor walk around the side of the cart|It was like my whole world was shattering, and even though I hadn't seen Zach enter, some part of me knew what I would see as soon as I turned. He was standing by the Homeland Security booth. He was searching the crowd, looking for me. He was just another teenager thinking about the future until I shouted, "Zach|He swept the flashlight across the ceiling, and there they were—hundreds of them hanging upside down, their wings folded against them like small black umbrellas. The ones not sleeping stared back at him through tiny eyes.  Now and then one would drop down and fly off.  
He thought about Bryan taking in the same scene|I remember the day he gave it to me, it was after my birthday party and he came to my room to say good night. My mom had already kissed me goodnight so he and I were alone. He sat on my bed and placed a tiny pink box in my hand.

"Daddy, you already gave me a birthday present!" I couldn't stop beaming at him because I was so excited to get another present|As always.

"Hey, I'm glad I ran into you. What are you doing for dinner tonight?" Savannah asked.

"Um ... I don't know. Why?"

"Want to come with me? I'll pick you up and everything."

"Are you asking me on a date, Savannah|We completed the block circle and were upstairs in our apartment just as the clock struck twelve. 
“Hey, what do you know? Richie’s a free man with respect to the Johnny B Code of Ethics,” Mike said as he and I turned into our bedroom.
“What do you mean by that, Mike|I have never dared to enter into the witch’s cauldron by myself, but I have seen it flown without her being in it. When the renegade we called Waxen Dwarf helped trap Princess Ringold’s mother, he was allowed to use her cauldron. He flew it by himself!” 
Christy asked Gloo, “How is that possible? Does the Waxen Dwarf possess magic?”
“No, I think it flew because the witch can store her magic in it, magic that controls the cauldron,” replied Gloo|"Yes, yes, they do, Stephanie.  Each year they have a whackero parade and your grandfather is in it.  Tomorrow when we wake up we have to dress up like mountain men and drive up to the mountains together and we'll all be in a parade of mountain men and whackeros."
"This is so weird," said Stephanie|His gaze moved over her from head to foot. She looked good enough to eat, he thought. Literally. She smelled good, too, like a fragrant breeze on a warm summer day.

"Me, either."

"How was your day?" he asked.

"Not very productive. I kept returning books to the wrong shelf|Monika rolled her eyes and muttered, “Fine, I suppose that’ll be fine enough for me, but this whole trip doesn’t mean that we have to suspend our life. It doesn’t mean that we can restrain our passions. It hardly seems healthy to me, especially your fears about me. I’ve always been strong enough to face anything, you know that. Childbirth and raising a child won’t be different|Boys.

"You have any paper towels?" I said.

"In the supplies box," Simon said, glancing around. "Here." He kicked the box with his foot. I got some out, handing them to both of the boys. Inevitably, one or both of them was going to spill|I’ll come out when I see you, don’t bother parking.”
“White Pathfinder, what’s the address?” Irina gave Bob the address and he entered it into the GPS navigator, an easy enough task when crawling along at five miles an hour.
Bob barely made it to Palo Alto in time to check in at the Garden, quickly wash up and then head out to pick up Irina|Anna asked as she turned one of the other boots upside down and struck the bottom of it with her hand a few times.
“Oh, I don’t know,” I replied. “I’m just thinking about some of the books I saw today.”
Anna looked at me and asked, “What books|"I just can't figure this stuff out. I thought my last paper was perfect and I got a C!"

Levi turned to me with mock shock. "A C? Alert the authorities."

I crossed my arms. "Yes, because caring about my grades somehow makes me lame."

"That's not what makes you lame|The raptors fanned out as they came closer, one staying in the center, the other two moving to each side. Coordinated. Smooth. Gennaro shivered.

Pack behavior.

Muldoon was already crouching, setting the launcher on his shoulder. "Load," he said. Gennaro slipped the shell in the back of the launcher|"We have to split up, make them divide their forces," I said.
Zach considered, then nodded reluctantly. "Make them chase and search for us."
"We'll meet out there," I said. I pointed into the Pacific Desert.
"In the wastes? Julia, we can't," said Zach|Even with a substantial amount of pills and no treatment it would take a few days to die, and it would be a painful and cruel way to go. The liver can’t break down the Tylenol, so it will be severely damaged. Most of the 450 women and girls are now being treated for liver damage, and many may need liver transplants down the road.” He had a calming voice.
“Is Amber going to need a transplant|"H-he bit me."

The primal virus.

She grabbed Jamie's arm. "Come with me to the lab, now."

"I'm dead! I'm dead!" He jerked away from her and bent to grab a chunk of wood. Then he was back, his hands shaking, as he grabbed her fingers and curled them around the wood|Even so, Chara took Sara’s hand and smeared the jelly across her palm. The relief was instantaneous. It felt cool and soothing. “Thank you,” she said. 
A bump came from the front of the house. It sounded like a door opening. Chara and Adelpha looked at each other with eyes wide and then they looked at Sara|"That's great news.  Maybe we'll start to make some progress now."
Stan exchanged a quick glance with Mr. Courtlen.  Nella ignored it.  "I guess you'll be wanting Frank then," he said.
Nella smiled.  "If you're ready Mr. Courtlen."
"As I'll ever be," said Frank, "Have a good day Stan|'A black-hooded monk - who lacks one of his ten fingers.'

'Hmmn. Brother Guido has only nine toes. Are you sure it wasn't a toe?'

'Quite sure.'

'And then there's Brother Domenico, but it's his entire left arm he's lacking.'

'No. I'm sorry, but I'm quite sure it was a finger|Despite his many centuries of living, for the most part he felt not much older than he'd been when he graduated from the Elite Academy with Aidan.

Sure, he could no longer f**k all night and tear up Nightmares the next day without feeling like rubber. But that was more of a dig to his male pride, than it was a sign of his age.

Right now, though, he felt every one of his years|He reached under the table and grabbed a two-gallon jug of generic peanut butter. "Can you handle it?"

"I'm an expert," I said.

He watched me work. The line was momentarily short; he wanted to talk.

"I thought you were a lawyer," I said, spreading peanut butter.

"I'm a human first, then a lawyer|If I were a guy I'd totally do you." Her dead serious expression told me she wasn't kidding.

I inspected myself in the large mirror. This was a dress I'd never wear back home, but we weren't back home. No one knew me here. Besides, Sylvie was right, I looked hot|"Barrett said his dad told him you were very small," she added wryly, "and he wasn't kidding."

"For Martin's wedding present," I said steadily, "I want to buy him the farm he grew up on. Can you tell me where it is? I haven't told the realtor I want to see this one particular farm because of course she'll know I want it for some reason, and Joseph Flocken won't sell to me if he knows I'm going to give it to Martin|I asked from around the sudden lump of fear in my throat.
Christophe waved a little hand. "Your choice."
"What to meet the president?" I asked Lynette.
"I don't have anything I could wear to something like that." Her face turned red. 
"Dress uniforms for all," said Christophe|Nicholas lowered his gaze to meet hers and nodded solemnly. "Because I turned you."

Her eyebrows flew up, and Jo stared at him for a moment and then asked, "Turned me? You mean you gave me nanos and now I'm like you?"

Nicholas nodded grimly, and then blurted, "I'm sorry, Jo|I looked at the kid who ran into me, and he did the same. But his reaction was a lot different then mine. The kid turned around and came back over to me. He grabbed my shirt, touching me. He was my height, but I was still scared. 
“What are you looking at, kid|“Well, did you forget about me?” said Vidal. 
“I’m sorry,” said Ana. “Hi. I was distracted for a moment.”
Vidal was not alone. Kim was standing next to him.
“Mind if we sat down?” said Vidal.
“Not at all, please,” said Ana|‘
Her thoughts immediately ran to her brother, who no doubt was still by the fire. What was left of the thick wooden trees had gone flying in the direction of their lodgings. She knew they were not built nearly strong enough to withstand these kinds of winds. This gust put all the English winds to shame. It almost didn’t even feel like a wind|* * *

Alex sat down in the hotel restaurant across from Rachel. He didn't want to be here. He had no desire to sit across from the woman who'd broken his heart and talk about anything. And if he had to be here, he preferred Madison be by his side. He didn't like the look on her face when she'd told him to go with Rachel|The half smile still played on his lips. There was a long silence.

"Oh, look. It's Hamnet. He's not dead," said Ripred finally. The rat picked up what appeared to be a human skull and started to gnaw on it.

"The skull is a nice touch, Ripred," said Hamnet|The woman retrieved an object from her coat pocket and showed it to Sheffield before returning it to a shirt pocket. It was John's NSA satellite phone. "I am she," she replied, as she took off her heavy winter coat and made herself comfortable by sitting down in the booth opposite Sheffield. "Did you bring me what I requested|In other words, a fake wall had been built 

and there were no doors or windows on the inside or outside 

of those walls to give access to the unexplained extra 

footage. So, she told him to tear the wall out.”

Manda and Teresa glanced at each other.

“Ah…a mystery,” said Manda|He was at least a hundred yards from the intersection. Crouched low, he looked back and studied the scene. He memorized the parked cars and then focused on the truck, which had stopped. A short, heavy man had jumped from the cab to bend over the three wounded men. Smith did not recognize him, but he knew that truck|Do you like it?”
Bryn was quiet for a moment as if she was trying to find the right words to say.  “I like parts of it.”
“Which parts?”
“I like that my father is a teacher there,” she explained.  “He makes sure I’m put in the best classes|"Okay then," the enactor said, holding up the blank disc of glass. "I show you lens making from beginning." He picked up a short wooden ruler and a sharp metal scribe in the other hand. "We must get the exact center of the disc, so it spins perfetto." The Master carefully used the crude ruler to determine the exact center of the disc, then scratched a small X into it with the scribe|Tom sighed.  “I probably wasn’t as gentlemanly as I should have been.”
Jessica burst out laughing.  “Are you kidding?  That was great.” Then she quickly sobered.  “Your ma doesn’t allow critters into the house, does she?”
“That depends on what you call a critter|She will accompany you on the tour. Also for her it is the first time she is here. Meet her in the lobby in an hour.”
Pieter got up on his feet, still trying to interpret the information of the past talks. 
“I will be there.” 
Iveta added quickly: “why don't you take Jane with you, Pieter|He was very eager to go to the sacred isle.” 
Fiach pointed down the beach. “The fisherfolk are coming.”
“Shouldn’t the Decangi cross before us?” Tadhg asked. “They arrived before we did.” 
“They’re waiting for another group,” Fiach said. “They’ve agreed we should be first|Lita’s ship looked like one great vessel of bereavement. Even the sails were jet black. The closer he got the more impatient he grew. Under the dim, morning skies, he saw images of men loading coffins onto her ship. 
“Hurry!” He hollered. 
He grew more anxious by the second. There were coffins that had yet to be loaded|Yesterday morning everything was still the same as ever and then suddenly ... I feel as if my head's splitting, having to take so much in all at once-thousands of scraps of information that won't fit together properly."

"I'm so sorry," said Mum. "I hoped to spare you all this."

"What was it you once did to make them all so cross with you?"

"I helped Lucy and Paul to get away," said Mum|Just as Shane started to breathe easier, the boat lurched, then suddenly stalled, nearly knocking him off his feet. Gripping the wheel tightly, he looked out, horrified when he saw the hole in the side of his yacht. He must have hit a reef.

The boat was going down. "Lia, we have to abandon ship. Grab the emergency pack and we'll get in the lifeboat|Honour yells.
I try to claw my way out of the pain but I’d really like to sleep.
“You know I’ll keep you safe. Anything else can happen and I won’t care, but I won’t let a single thing happen to you.”
“That sounds dangerously close to a promise|“Mr. Holmes is not gonna like that,” said Stacie.
A black spot scrambled away.  They had left the flashlight somewhere on the ground, but they were certain they wouldn’t have wanted to see what happened to the shed or what ran from them.
“Now I really hope Mr. Holmes doesn’t look back here,” said Stacie|See, Uncle Dane, it has the same purple stone in it.”
Dane studied the ring and saw that it did look similar to the one he always wore on his right hand.  He raised his head and asked, “How much for this ring?”
The woman behind the counter widened her eyes in apparent surprise and she faltered a little as she said the price|He reached into the mini fridge for a bottle of water, then sat down opposite his manager.

Harry smiled, but it was a smile with a warning inside it. "The redhead?"

Graham tipped his head back and took a swig of water, his eyes on the ceiling. When he'd finished, he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and said, in a voice that didn't entirely sound like his own, "What redhead|"If you want me to beg then I'm begging you. Please, don't make me remember-"

So much f**king pain, he thought in agony as he looked at Velvet's tormented expression. So much f**king pain and he was the cause of it. Tearing her hands off her ears, Mykolas said roughly, "Listen to me, Velvet|"Hi," he said. He was gratified to see a funny look on Goldie's face.

Adie turned to Goldie, and then looked back at Brian. "Uh, you talking to me?"

"Yeah. I'm Brian Morton. And you are?"

"Adele," she stammered, unable to believe that this incredibly hot boy - the most desired stud on campus, if the rumors were to be believed - was speaking to her and not Goldie|He didn't want to discuss the case in a public place, where a lot of locals were hanging about. She put on her sweater and they found a bench on one of the docks overlooking the marina.
He said bluntly, “The cops are telling me this is arson. They want me to prosecute. What they haven't told me is who I'm supposed to prosecute|"But I don't even know how to use a sword."

"Apparently you learn quickly," said Ares, and somehow that made Gregor laugh a little. He looked around the cave. There were food supplies, blankets, spare torches.

"What's this place? Like, your hideout?" Gregor asked.

"Yes, my hideout," said Ares|he asked when Aaron was out of earshot. "You didn't leave it in the cab that dropped you off, did you?"

"No, I didn't bring anything. Just myself. I was hoping Maria might loan me a few things to wear."

Steven frowned. "You came all the way to Italy with nothing but the clothes on your back and a passport|"That's a lousy way to spend your wedding night," Topher said.
"I told you I'd seen worse.  Make you feel better?"
"A bit," Topher admitted.
Lashonda traced a claw around the edge of her precious marriage license.  She was glad that dogs and cats like the Chihuahua and the handcuffed tom had blazed the way, making it easier for her and Topher|Mark couldn't believe how quickly she'd gone from totally fine to literally on the ground, too weak to stand. "Go and let me figure this thing out. Maybe I just ate something weird." But Mark could tell she didn't believe that.

"We can't just keep abandoning people," the Toad said, glaring at Mark|The Marshall cried, “All rise!” and the nine Justices stood up and began filing out.
Orson looked at Joseph in astonishment and said, “So, that’s it? Chism’s case is dismissed, without him even being permitted to appear?”
“It’s far worse than that, Orson|“And when we’re sure they are off you must tell me everything, even the bad parts. I’ve arranged an expedited hearing in County Superior, and it’s better if we bring up damaging evidence before they do.”
Desmond thought. “How soon is expedited?” he asked. 
“Two days,” Cynthia replied. 
“Two days… that works,” said Desmond|Bob was pensive for the rest of the evening, talking openly and realistically about his work on the railroad to the four students who appeared enthused over the prospect of high speed rail in their lifetime. Perhaps they just hadn’t done the math.  
The couple that accompanied Paul and Debbie got up to leave, they were expecting the girl’s parents to fetch them any moment now. After they had left, Paul and Debbie looked at each other, then at Bob|When the Nameless was created, Rhys lost the power to raise armies of the dead. We had no more use for armies among ourselves, and to fight the humans in such a way would have meant our expulsion from this country." Frost hesitated, then said, "Many of us lost our most otherworldly powers when the Nameless was cast. But I do not know of any who lost so much as Rhys|"It means you're an idiot if you think I'm going to let you talk your way out of this."

She gestures for me to enter the lobby and I do. "I wasn't going to talk. I was going to kiss my way out of it. Do you have any idea how long it's been since we kissed?"

"If you talk to your brother, we'll kiss|It was close now. I was almost there.

No, Heven! It's a trap! Turn around!

Too late. A demon rushed me from the side and sent me crashing to the floor. The scroll fell out of my hands and rolled away into a shadowed corner.

The demon that sent me to the floor landed on top of me and was scrambling off me to get to the scroll|." 

Part of Stefan wanted to melt at Katherine's desperate look, at her tears. But wounded pride and jealousy were too strong, and he knew his face was as hard, as unyielding, as Damon's.

"No," he said. "We cannot. It must be one or the other, Katherine|Looking down, her profile hidden from Xandor by her long brown locks, she offered him a leather pouch. He wanted to take it as a memento of her, but if it held magic meant to help him, he didn’t want it. “What is it?”
Jenna chuckled. “He won’t bite you.”
“He?”
A grey mouse poked its head out the top of the pouch|Elijah and Chrissy headed out the driveway into the aroma of the flowers and then turned up the road to walk the half-mile to the top of the hill where the path started.
“My bucket’s bigger than your bucket,” Elijah said. “Bet I get more blackberries than you.”
“No way,” Chrissy said. “I plan on eatin' half the ones I pick|As a matter of fact, the very essence of a fact implied that it was the truth, something hard and fast although, no one was exactly sure what that meant, since some things were soft and slow.
However, the truth was that facts could be wrong.  For example, my APE frat brothers encouraged me to ask a girl to a college dance.  They said that they were certain that I would succeed|Everything was as it should be, neatly labeled, and stored in the back and across the street, according to the second letter Rose had left for her.

Summer glanced around the office, taking in the new desk, new desk chair, new computer, and plethora of family pictures. She ran a finger along the edge of a frame|She was one of those really strict teachers in her mid-50’s.  She wore glasses, polka-dot dresses, had a really pointy nose, and she kinda looked like a donkey.    
“Welcome to English 11. I am your English teacher, Mrs. Guanty,” the teacher said aloud to the class.       
A few people snickered. A nerdy guy sat there at his desk in the back playing a hand-held video-game, not paying attention to the teacher|Is there any way to tell where they were going?"
"The last sighting had them heading towards the binary Galleas System. It's not far from here."
"Then let's get a move on. Crusader, take it easy and keep your scanners on."
"Confirmed," the ship said.
The engines whirred back into action and the ship turned towards the Galleas System|"You can trust him, too."

Belinda gave him a curious look.

"This will be enough." The nurse disconnected them, then smoothed a bandage over Belinda's puncture. He stuck another bandage on Gregori's arm.

"Thank you." Gregori rolled down his sleeve.

Belinda looked over at Abigail asleep on the couch, then turned back to Gregori|"Look," Radomil told me in broken English. "We don't mind talking to you, but it's not going to help. You and the Wilson girl, it's made things complicated. You not married."

Yes, I know, I'm not married|He met regularly for breakfast with a thirty-four-year-old recently divorced banker who, unlike Frank, had been unable to achieve sobriety. Until then Amanda had not allowed herself to believe that Frank was actually going to be successful in the long term.

There was no question that Jared and the girls had benefited from the improved atmosphere at home. There had even been moments recently when Amanda considered it a new beginning for her and Frank|'White wine?'

'Foul muck.'

The genie looked shocked.

'Red is bad for -' it began.

'- but any port in a storm,' said Creosote hurriedly. 'Or sauterne, even. But no umbrella in it.' It dawned on the Seriph that this wasn't the way to talk to the genie|She'd just confessed that she was infatuated with him. And she wasn't about to explain how he looked like Carmine Falcone, or how framing him in her lens made the shadows disappear. If she was going crazy, then she'd try to go crazy in a dignified way.

Thankfully, he didn't respond to her confession|For the sake of the Dhamma, he said, for the sake of Ananda, he did not say.
“Forty-five years ago,” replied the Buddha, “I decided—and silently promised the world—not to attain to final Nibbana until the Dhamma was well established, and well taught.”
Ananda bowed his head that he understood.
“I have now accomplished that,” said the Buddha|I breathed deeply several times to get my breath back.  “He took the card,” I said.
Greg pulled out his phone and called the cops.  He and Jackie helped me to the couch.  
“What happened?” asked Rachel reappearing.
“Where were you,” demanded Greg.
“I went after the car,” said Rachel|“Bonnie’s up in her room,” Melissa answered.  “I don't care what you say, I’m getting my daughter.”

Johnson commanded, “Andrews, grab Ms. Odin.  We’re getting out of here.”
“No!”  Melissa insisted, “Not until we get Bonnie|For the hungrier set there seemed to be every kind of fowl, from quail to goose, neatly carved into small pieces so a dancer could eat quickly and return to the floor.

Once again I wished I was hungry for normal human food. But instead I indulged in a glass of champagne.

"Hilda, Hilda," Bridget called out in a voice that carried well considering how crowded the space was. A beautiful girl in a rose-pink gown turned from her gentleman friend, face lighting up when she saw Bridget|John was confused, as to their part in all of this.
“They were not important.  They were simply needed to set the scene.”
He paused again before he continued, “I bet you’re wondering about the lawyer’s wife, aren’t you?  She was a symbol of your marriage.  Those two had a beautiful and happy marriage just as you did, John|I think we owe each other that, don't you?"

"You should be!"

She sighed. "All right then, you're forgiven|He stopped off and had a cup of coffee at Charlie’s Grill. Charlie wouldn’t take a dime from him that day or any other. Charlie stood by Ben while he drank his cup. 
“What is it, Ben?” There was an unspeakable sadness in Charlie’s question.
“I’m afraid I don’t know, Charlie|It tasted delicious, the secret smiles Drew and I shared as we were surrounded by dozens of strangers making my head light and my heart sing.

After the party, we officially went to bed, where my husband made love to me for hours.

Now I huddle outside, the cool, gentle sea breeze sending my hair everywhere and making me shiver since I'm only wearing a thin nightgown. I look at my phone and find a text message from Drew|It was as though Miss LeTorque was actually daring them to do so or had absolute faith they would or could not. He was silently pondering his thoughts when he noticed Smith and the Lady LeTorque arrive at the point in their conversation where the actual meat of information was to be revealed.
“What exactly can we do for you, Miss LeTorque|He sat her down and made a great show of patting her legs dry with the edge of his shirt.

"So, Virginia," he said. "What was up last night? You're off Walter Lloyd, and youUve moved on to Barry?"

"No, I was never on Walter, and I haven't moved on to Barry|He combed through along her scalp, strands slithering across his fingers. "The feel of your hair."

A moan slipped past her lips along with his name, "Tony..."

"Antonio," he reminded her. "I want to hear you say my name, know who's here with you."

And in this moment, in his eyes, he was that foreign prince, less accessible than her Tony, but no less exciting and infinitely as irresistible, so she whispered, "Antonio|I made a second trip to my car and was returning with a large watermelon when a feeling of unease rippled through me.  The fine hairs at the nape of my neck stood upright.  Before I could set the heavy melon down on the kitchen counter, I sensed someone else in the room and spun around.
“Hello, Carly,” Robert said.
Shock and a jolt of something foreign that may have been fear ran through my midsection and I dropped the watermelon|I heard half the class laughing, and I turned to see for whom the laughter was directed at.  A fat Mayo is walking toward me.  He is all smiles at everyone even though they were teasing him.  And who wouldn’t?  He decided to dress up as a watermelon.  Only his head showed on top of his costume|“Here,” said Jacob, handing them what was a rope attached to the ground next to them, the other end at the bottom of the well.  “You first.” 
Will stood there.  Why am I doing this? he thought. 
“Come on, let’s go!” ordered Jacob. 
Will took the rope and began to climb down the well. 
“Thatta boy, you’ve got this,” said Jacob|"I don't believe anyone has called her that since the day I took the girls in. She just looked me in the eye and became my little Micki. But she missed out on the girlie stuff her sisters enjoyed and they never thought to include her since she seemed to like sports so much more."

With a groan, Damian leaned against the window-sill, exhausted from no sleep and overwhelmed with the desire to understand what he could do to fix things between himself and Micki|"Sorry about that. Looks like the bathroom is out of commission. The one in the master is all torn up with remodeling, so for now I guess we're without facilities. Tell you what ... I'll just drop a check by your place tomorrow. I can leave it with your wife or put it in your mailbox|"I'm standing here, trying to be friendly," said Amos. "I was told there was nothing of interest down here. And since it is so dull, I thought I would keep you company."

The sailor fingered his key awhile, then said, "That is kind of you, I suppose."

"Yes, it is," said Amos|In his midtwenties, Mark had shaggy brown hair and bright green eyes. Dressed in a baggy tan T-shirt that had seen better days, he looked like he hadn't shaved in a couple of days.

Ah, that was where Bubba's beard had gone.

Mark had been working for Bubba off and on for years. But more than that, the two of them were best friends, and Mark was every bit as crazy as Bubba|I'm not about to let you die."

That was easier said than done. Pain lacerated her body. It was as if she was burning from the inside out.

Unable to stand it, she screamed until she could stand no more. This was it. In spite of what he said, she was dying|"Others must have survived it and lived to tell the tale if your Doctor Neveeve has a record of it in her books. That means it can be done. And if it can be done, then we can do it. Hamnet, what do you suggest?"

"Stay very close together. Walk in twos or even threes if possible. But avoid touching any plant. And under no circumstances, leave the path," said Hamnet|He was at work. I shouldn't bother him. But I was supposed to be important. If he still cared at all, he'd answer me.

I battled with myself over it. In my past, obsessive texting and calling had been my biggest weakness. For more than a year after I started therapy, I didn't even allow myself to have a phone|‘Without witnesses?’ asked Archie.
‘I’d have witnessed it.’ It was a woman’s voice.
‘Mary! What are you doing out here?’
She had her revolver cocked and nervously held it at the group of scabs with two hands.
‘Put that down, sweetheart,’ said Archie|"Our children will have the Earth. That is enough."

"It is not enough!" Harley shouts. He's almost at the front now; he's almost at Eldest. "It will never be enough, not until I can feel real dirt beneath my feet!"

Eldest steps forward, and then he's in front of Harley|Sister Magdalene, Brother Tim, Father Frank and Sister Clarissa would represent the Community. They were the only ones left besides Mercy who were not bed-ridden. Sister Clarissa was in a wheelchair, and would be attended by a nurse who was strong enough to push the chair. 
Somehow the bishop found out that Mercy was not planning to attend. He called Christina and asked her to lean on Mercy|"Really, there was never any doubt as to the outcome of this game."

"You play well for a beginner," Bobby told him.

Teri ruffled her younger brother's hair, despite knowing how much he hated it. "Consider that a compliment."

Johnny smiled. "I will." He pushed back his chair and looked at Teri|"Very well, Dr. Pazzo," she said, "Is there anything else?"
He straightened his shoulders and looked up at her brightly.  "Well, not as a requirement, but maybe a favor? I'd really love some books."
Nella shot a confused look at Mr. Courtlen but his face was impassive.  "They won't let you have books|He knew his scars had either frightened or disgusted her. Not that he blamed her for the honest reaction. His appearance was shocking. There was no help for it.

He heard the front door open behind him. The heavy fall of footsteps told him it was Logan and not Hope.

"I presume things did not go well," said Logan|Jason and Ron are hugging on the far side.  I’m glad Marissa is still sleeping so she won’t get jealous.  She is still lying there motionless.  Jim is washing Baby Seth all over.  He is so tiny.  I can’t believe how little he is.  We watch for a few more minutes till Jim covers the baby back up and places him down next to Marissa|While Emily takes a shower, I stand by the balcony watching my mother drive off in her executive Saloon V3. As the car disappears behind the hedges, I sneak to the garage to see the new bike.
It’s dark and quiet, but darkness is my friend now. Not wanting to turn the lights on, I struggle to find the bike|We walk to the movie theater just a couple of blocks away and he still wows me with his chivalrous behavior. What kind of guy still opens doors? Avery does. He buys my ticket, a huge bucket of popcorn and a lemonade and a couple boxes of candy. We sit down in the side aisle with the single set of two seats. It’s nice and cozy and there’s almost no one in the theater|We’re on our way.”
After she hung up, Melody swore. “I can’t see the sheriff. I’m going to get into so much trouble. The cops are going to know that I had a fake I.D.”
“Us too,” I replied. “But I think when they find out what’s happening at the club, they might be a little more lenient|I just want to find out what happened to Lystus. And I'm going to give you the same answers I gave Campus Security, so you're just wasting your time. Don't you all have criminals you can go grill for information?"
Gaent ignored her. "When was the last time you saw Lystus|"It's only the stupid frogs and then Dad does the shark thing and splashes everyone and then they all go home. " "I'll do the frogs, " Wanda piped up. "Oh all right, " said Nora. "They're nasty, slimy things anyway. " She picked up the red frog bucket and handed it to Wanda|In any event, I intend to vote for Mr. Wheaton's bill."

"Oh, Nate!" Lottie cried, and threw her arms most improperly about his neck.

Beatrice looked down, smiling as Lottie and Mr. Graham embraced.

"Sir! Sir!" a servant called. "Gentlemen are not allowed in the ladies' side of the gallery|"A pity squared: first that I have none to eat and second that I can't remember eating one to begin with! Where is my shirt, Will Henry?"

"I think I saw it on your wardrobe, sir."

I trailed behind him into the bedroom. As he buttoned his shirt, I said, "I could run down there now, sir|I step into the pit and once I reach him, I lift him above my head and I toss him, making him laugh harder. He somehow manages to get his feet underneath himself and wades towards me, looking like he is fighting a hard current. "Let's go ober there." He points to a large trampoline that is built into the floor before taking my hand, leading the way out of the pit|They could click it and they could probably find someone who would listen.
Robert Murland seemed to have the desire and capacity for doing harm.  He didn’t seem to have any great interest in the Holy Talisman, but he might have wanted it after learning of the impact of its theft.  Who was his source?  The CUB news truck arrived too soon after the theft|I was angry, but I agreed.
"We had the party, and it wasn't as wild as Deidre thought it would be.  I did, however, end up getting drunk.  I kept true to my promise and had you come pick me up.  I knew your whole reason for being there was to spy on me for Deidre|There was still no lighting on the side where the Dark Master sat in his throne, his face still hidden in the darkness that surrounded his entire body.  The only light was the light from a circle of dimly lit torches circling Charlie, who now sat in complete fear.  
It was very hot in this particular room.  
The Dark Master then began to speak to Charlie|"This food was prepared for the coronation. Please, begin."

Gregor lifted his bread, dipped it in the cream sauce, and took a big bite.

For a while, they all concentrated on the food. Except Nerissa, who seemed to be mostly rearranging hers.

"I am afraid I am a poor conversationalist," said Nerissa|It was just a dream, she told herself. No one can change colors or collapse people by touching them in real life. I heaved a sigh and got out of bed to get ready for school. 
I shouldered my bag and try to get through the swarm of kids surrounding me. 
Sometimes being popular is a bust, I thought as I pushed against the tide of kids|Both of her parents had the most wonderful Indian accents, even though they had been in America for many years.
Her two younger twin brothers kept asking Joshua about the band and wanted their parents to let them go to a concert with TUA.
“You are too young.” Their father shut them down and turned to Joshua|“Whoa,” responded Will and Starr in unison, staring up at Rocky’s size and rock-like structure.    
“Okay, well now that we’re all here,” began Charlie, “let’s make this short and sweet.  Guys, this is Rocky.”    
“Uh, hello,” said Will, still staring up at Rocky|"What's up with the radio silence?" I asked in a quiet voice as kids streamed past us. "Six hours between notes is not acceptable."

Thayer's brow furrowed. "Yesterday? I was busy," he said after a moment.

"Too busy to text 'I'm busy|Roy walked right up to her, dropped his suitcase at his feet and smiled. "You must be Rose Marie, Mary's granddaughter. I'm glad I made it back in time to meet you. I hear Walt's takin' you up to the cabin."
"Why, yes, I'm Rose Marie, and yes, I'm going to her cabin|Ben decided that Salem must be saving the animal, knowing that he might have to ride it for days and not wanting to wear it out on the first leg of his escape.
At last Ben topped a small rise and saw a man far below watering his horse.  Ben turned and rode back down out of sight, then went back up on foot and took a look.  It was impossible at that distance to make out the man's face, but Ben knew it was Salem|"I know how you feel," she said. "But I don't think Rebecca will go anywhere. She's obviously taken with that other man at the reception. What was his name? Josh Something?"

The surprise that jolted Delaney eased the lump in her throat. "You noticed? You're a complete stranger, and you noticed|But what did they ever actually talk about but the latest scandal at work or where to go for dinner. That all seemed pretty meaningless too.
Is that why Michael wanted children? To give life some purpose.
She thought about her time with Sky. It certainly filled the day with things to do, but she couldn’t see how it gave life meaning. Headaches, heartache, insomnia, but not meaning|First officer rested his arm on the flap/slat handle, moved the handle down, extending the slats. Several passenger injuries.

"Yeah, but I know you."

Savannah sighed. "I invited him to Hilton Head with us."

"And?" Liz had a feeling she knew where this was going.

"Lucas is going to be there."

"Do you think something will happen between you and Lucas|It reflected the light as he nudged it, watching it sparkle.

Ty sat on the floor, leaning back against the couch and looking exhausted. Deuce lounged on the other end of the sofa, his feet up on a stool in front of him. Earl and Mara sat on the loveseat across the room. They cuddled together, Mara curled in the crook of Earl's arm draped over the back of the loveseat|He left out the part about the message and him being chosen, however, since he was not sure what Alden might think.
“So, you’re supposed to go get the scale of a red dragon?” confirmed Alden in the end.
“Yes, and you’re supposed to help me,” remarked Andy matter-of-factly.
Alden stopped. “But I don’t know anything about dragons|The only thing I’m not sure of is we won’t know if the antidote works until the last second.”
“If we discover it in time we will know,” explained Craig.
“How can we be sure it will be permanent?” asked Amber. “Another horrid thought I’m thinking of is what if Crompton is lurking about watching our every move hoping we’ll lead him to the antidote|“It is…”
Sarah’s smile faded and she reached out to touch Tess’s arm.  “Sorry… Tell me what you want to say…”
Tess rode for a minute alongside Sarah and looked out at the hills. Then she focused on Sarah’s face and became quite serious.
“I was married for a few years, Sarah|She's thin and gorgeous."

"You're gorgeous. And Rosa, she and I are toxic together. We bring out the worst in each other. I wouldn't want you to be like her."

"So why do you let her come around here?" Marley had wondered that ever since he had confessed that his one-night stand had been with Rosa|asked Phidias of an older ephebos.
"They're students in Plato's Academy. I think they put on too many airs."
"Why do they dress alike?"
“They wear those caps and gowns to show they belong to the Academy and to set themselves apart.”
"I overheard some of their conversation," said Phidias|Isabella cocked her head to one side, her perfectly manicured nail tapping on her crimson-stained lower lip. "No, it is not quite right. But we are getting closer." She turned to the shop assistant and spoke in rapid Italian.

As far as Sophia could tell, they weren't getting any closer. She'd tried on at least twenty dresses, some too long, some too short, some too revealing, others not revealing enough, according to Isabella|He knew if Pip told of the single kiss he had planted on his head were to come out, it would end his career in teaching forever.
The next day Mr Barnes waited until the end of his double English class with the Sixth Form.
“Pip, can you stay behind?  I want to clarify with you the difference between ‘there’ and ‘their’.  You are being a bit fast and loose with the two words|"I see you two had a busy night."

Sophia blinked the sunlight out of her eyes becoming aware of Zero lying right close behind her, along with the evidence of his happiness to be that close. Jumping out of bed she headed toward the kitchen without looking back. There was nothing going on between her and Zero|“Hey guys, nice ta see you again.”
“Hi, Caleb.” I smile as Hunter nods.
“Well, we’ll let you two get back to working out your ‘miscommunication’ (she air quotes for extra emphasis). See you inside for dinner.” Dhelia sends Hunter a sly wink before disappearing into the house with Caleb|And since I'm the one best equipped to keep you safe, I do."

Incredulity burst out of her. "I keep me safe."

For a split second, his eyes said she knew nothing.

This brought her sitting up. "Are you telling me you saved me from a danger I was unaware of?"

Another blip said he'd saved her from far more than a danger|She was bad off, panicked and delusional, and she hurt herself she tripped on the stairs and bruised her back and elbow. She wouldn't let me touch her, kept screaming at me and calling me Shaun. I gave her a sleeping pill to help her relax. She needs a good night's rest. Same goes for you-can I get you a pill|"I eat every day Mr. Black, not that it is any of your concern." He suddenly looked intrigued as he set his menu down.

"It's just you are very thin."

What the f**k is this man's problem. First, he says we are not friends; then he calls me anorexic.

"This is the way I was born; I've always been thin|"Hey buddy, how are you?" Connor smiled. The boy hugged him tight. "Camden, this is my special friend Ellery." Camden looked at me with his blue eyes and just stared.

Hi Camden," I smiled and held out my hand. He continued to stare, unsure of me, and then looked back at Connor|“It’s right over there,” Mindy said. “It goes to a hot springs.” She pointed. “It said it was a mile.”
“Perfect.”
“It said to be ‘Bear Aware.’ Do we have any bear spray?”
“Uh, that would be a no|Kylie attempted to move between the two men. But too late.

No one stopped.

Her grandfather swung his fist and Burnett took the blow square on the jaw.

While not nearly as young as Burnett, her grandfather didn't lack strength, and Burnett hit the ground.

The sound of pure fury leaked from someone, and Kylie assumed it was Burnett|I nod, shifting my laptop a bit to make room for him. “I thought I told you not to follow me last night.”
Kelly flashes his engaging grin stretching the scar, “I didn’t. I followed your trail this morning. I can smell you.”
“Okay, that’s a little creepy. I mean the smelling thing more than the following|The air filled with flowers rising from the earth, sprinkling the boughs like diamonds, until I could no longer tell the difference between the boughs and the starry night sky beyond.
A flower flew close and turned into a miniature dragonfly, glowing silver-white.
Audrey’s face filled my vision as she bent to look at me. “Are you alright?”
“I’m hallucinating,” I said.
“No, the drink’s worn off, you can’t be hallucinating|"It's weird how they're all on Main Street," I said.

"It's the security alarm at Gose Jewelers. They're attracted to sound." Dad slowed at the intersection, and even though the light was red, he didn't stop.

"No one else is on the road, Dad|"Yet you've been staying at his place..."

"In the guest room."

"Sure, the 'guest room.'" He made air quotes. His skepticism reminded me of Jared. I wondered where he fit into all of it. Was he still in New York with Toby?

"I'm not sleeping with him."

"Maybe not yet, but it's inevitable|She expected some sign of irritation from Leon, as was usually the case when someone said something against his will. Instead he smiled sardonically.
 “It’s too late to take care of me,” he said. “You know, what? I came to terms with everything around me. With people, events, and with whatever is bound to happen.”
 “Don’t go too far this way, Leon|Animal control teams were working hard to round up the panthers, but the creatures were extremely stealthy.

When the news broke for commercials, Spencer felt her mother's eyes on her. She slid off the stool, prepared to hustle up to her room so her mom didn't have to endure her presence. Then her mother let out a regretful sigh. "I'm sorry about how I've behaved toward you in the past few days, Spencer|"So, you need to realize that your dad is just 'dad' to you, but to some people he's a really big deal, and for good reason."

Sam rolls his eyes at me and then turns to Chet. "Well, I guess we'll see you later, Chet|He was walking down a narrow twisting country lane, with Ben on his back and Julie laughing by his side. They were all slightly damp from a recent shower and Jack was trying to sing a song, struggling a little as he couldn’t remember the words. Julie knew them, but just laughed at his wild guesses.
Then, as the rain started up again, they came to a small cottage, hidden from the lane|It was yellow in colour and he watched as it rolled to a stop.  A child of about seven ran out from the trees and picked it up.  He looked up, and as if he saw Steven watching, waved and then ran back into the trees.
Steven was shocked, he couldn't move, the little boy had seen him and had waved|A small scream escaped her, but she landed in a shallow stream of frigid water. The fall had only been a meter or so.

"Watch out!" Gray called.

Rachel rolled clear as the others slid, skidded, and dropped into the water with her. Rachel retrieved her cell phone from the edge of the stream|You seem to be a walking arsenal."

"You are a walking arsenal," Jubal accused. "Joie, how did you get mixed up with him? And it's obvious you're talking with him telepathically."

Joie burst out laughing. "You sound so accusing, Jubal. I told you I was talking to him telepathically|He was proud; you should have seen the huge grin on his face as they handed the ribbon to him.

Caleb got teased by his friends for proudly displaying it on his sports trophy shelf. They started calling him names and accused him of having a secret affair with our three-hundred-pound English teacher, Ms. Bolinsky. After that, Leah told me he gave her the ribbon|Lorenzo extended his hand.  “Pleased to meet you.”
Mr. Loya’s eyebrows didn’t loosen, but he still shook Lorenzo’s hand.  “I thought you two were getting an annulment.”
“That’s what I understood,” commented Mrs. Loya.
“We’ve decided against it,” announced Lorenzo|“Ryan told me he had found a woman and he was going to get married. I kissed him to congratulate him.”
A sigh of relief followed. “Oh, that’s all it was. I knew it.”
“Today’s really not my day. First, Bertha Hoff calls and reproaches me for spending too much on laundry and painting services, and then you accuse me of having an affair with Ryan|The three kids hit it off instantly and made plans to ditch the 'rents and go hide out in the teen club after dinner. Bev took an immediate dislike to the mother of the other kids. The woman suggested that she and Bev go to the casino together after dinner. Bev declined, saying (truthfully) that she was way to cheap to be a gambler|"There's some wind, your Highness," the colonel replied, "and there are almost always rain squalls around the tip of the peninsula."

"Thank you, Colonel."

He bowed and quietly left the room.

Garion let out his breath explosively.

"Lord Belgarath." Prala's voice was crisp. "You cannot expose the Lady Tamazin to that kind of weather|"There has to be something."

"We do not know what would hold a goblin from fading."

"His mother was sidhe. Save him the way you'd save another sidhe."

Doyle looked a little disdainful, as if I'd insulted them all.

"Don't go all high and mighty on me, Doyle|Ben held a hand up as if keeping the growing crowd back. “He says he can explain.”
“He better get on with it,” said one Confederate reenactor.
Anna stepped forward and said, “I’ll explain.”
A man stepped forward, took off his cap and expressed his disbelief. “There’s no good explanation for what you just did,” he said to Anna|That he was clearly still worried, even a little dubious, was inherent by the way that Tom continued staring at him. 

“Trust me, I’m fine, or I will be,” Chris assured him, and he wondered if it was more for his own peace of mind than Tom’s. “It usually passes off, given time.” 

Tom merely huffed out a meaningless sound, yet didn’t take his eyes from Chris|The words on the page in front of me are just lines and dots and curves. There are also charts and pictures, but none of them mean anything to me. I dive back into taking notes and hope that something penetrates my brain. This time though, I catch Jett glancing up at me from the pad of paper. Just little flicks of his gorgeous eyes up to me and then back to the paper|Jerry dropped her eyes and tried not to remember the education she acquired at the same age. 
Ethan followed the direction of her thoughts and kept talking. “What’s your kitchen specialty? Or do you cook at all?”
“I make a mean chicken noodle soup.” Jerry neglected to tell him that it was from a can|With that simple reply, she leaned in to kiss him again.
“Are you up for finishing the tour?” he asked when he pulled back for air. “If not, I can go get the truck while you wait inside, and we can go.”
Mia slipped her hand in his again. “I’ll never make another hour walking, but I can make it to the truck|Seeing you ... go through chemo. It wrecked me, Aundrea. I want to help you, and I don't want to fail you."

"You'll never fail me, Parker. You are helping. Just being here with me is helping."

"Having you here, in my bed and in my arms, thinking about these past couple months ... your cancer, everything, my mind is racing, and ..."

"Just say it, Parker|“You make it sound as though you’re planning on seeing me again.” 

He turned a quick flash of a grin upon Chris when he gave a surprised inhalation.

“I didn’t mean that to sound so stalker-ish,” Chris said, with a worried frown. “I might be a lot of things, but I’m no stalker|The lead man turned his head and gave a sharp nod at a short stocky man holding a large metal net in his hands.
“The net won’t be necessary,” said Haleton.
“We’ve been waiting a long time for you to arrive. If the rumours about you are true, the steel net will be used.”
“Again I tell you there is no need to use the net|“This is not the time to think about what you want.”
She groaned. After a long minute, she reluctantly nodded. “I’ll try harder,” she said in a whisper. She made a gagging noise as Donnica whispered something in her ear. Shaking her head, she pulled away from me.
“Nice going,” I said to Donnica|I know it's late, but-"

"What's wrong?" He cut in before she could get out another word.

"Well, I want to ask you a hypothetical question."

He glanced at the face of the bedside alarm clock again. "It's almost one o'clock in the morning so I'm going to assume that this question is more than hypothetical|In the middle of enemy territory, with armed men patrolling only meters away, she was crying because there really was one person in this hostile world who still trusted her.

What I know is I want to get you safe|The race was not between the new house and me, but it was between the hare and the tortoise. I was expecting to win only because I was the tortoise. Between the race of new houses’ prices and my earnings, which would stop rising first? Of course it was my earnings; for the prices of houses will keep moving up and up always; whether or not I even take part in the race|What is it, Nell? What’s happened?’
Mary took Nell’s hands. ‘You’re frozen. Tell me what’s wrong, Nell.’
Nell continued to stare into nothingness as Mary wrapped a blanket around her shoulders then got the fire going.
‘Won’t you tell me what’s wrong, Nell|“How about $100 for each of the chairs..."
“$200? That is not a great price,” Kevin said.
“But the difference is, these really are Adirondack in style. Handmade. Not something from Pottery Barn.”
“Interesting.”
“Do you have any more of these chairs|My mind had been made up for me, especially when she placed a heaping plate of chilaquiles with egg mixed in, rice, beans, and a pink tinged liquid in front of me. My mouth was sticky and dry, so I naturally went for the drink right away. The alluring smell of the food was making it water|repeated Roy.
“Yes, you have a body now. Why don’t you blow up the ship.”
Roy pauses and looks around, “That’s an excellent idea.”
He turns from me and becomes absorbed with tearing off the panel around the ships drive. I took the opportunity to run from the ship|Margaret had hung back during this exchange, but she came forward now, and grasped Keira’s hands in her own. 
“Don’t be concerned with my husband’s ways, my dear,” she said gently. “He can be a bit overwhelming, but he has a kind heart.” She tossed a smile over her shoulder at her husband, who scowled at her playfully, before she returned her attention to Keira|She found her mobile phone and called Imogen.  The others could hear Imogen’s squeak of outrage at the news that Cuffy was in a home for dementia patients.  The visit was settled for later that afternoon.
“Why are you so worried about this Cuffy?” James wanted to know.
“I just think he shouldn’t be in that kind of home|Michelle broke into a sprint. "Come on, run!"
"What exactly are we fighting?" gasped Indal, pelting after her. If only he was in better shape! He couldn't keep up with a dancer.
"Monsters!"
"Great." Indal fumbled in his pocket for the key to the handcuffs, unlocked them and handed them to Michelle|"The lad may be a self-absorbed brat, but he's no devil. Have a drink, Derek. It might loosen you up."

I watched with disgust as my own father brushed off the thought of having given away his own daughter to the nobleman's son. I gritted my teeth, knowing fully well that the Maslens were far from noble|"I realize that, Solo," she said with a grin.

Their gazes met, and she suspected the same fire that crackled in his also crackled in her own.

"Do you want me?" he asked.

"More than anything."

"Then have me."

She did. Oh, she did.

Vika propped herself up on one elbow and peered down at Solo|Instead of cringing and cursing my heart, I rol ed my eyes and laughed to let him know I knew exactly what he was thinking. I surprised myself with the action, but I was feeling free, swept away by the atmosphere and the roaring energy of the room.

He grinned as he opened his menu and muttered something under his breath. His smile was evident even as he buried his face in the menu|He showed me to a computer terminal and explained too slowly their per-minute pricing plan.

I nodded through his little speech and signed on to the Web.

Kiss time.

That, I realized, was the key. The first email had said kiss time, not 6:15 P.M. Why? The answer was obvious. That had been code - in case the wrong people got their hands on the email|I was tired of asking questions, and every answer left me more confused.

Mum didn't seem to want to answer me either. She was looking out the window. "Nothing's changed here, anyway. It's as if time has stood still."

"Did you come here a lot when you were younger?"

"My father sometimes brought me with him," said Mum|He'd made a good choice when he'd gone after her to help his niece and nephew. There had been many other people who would have done an adequate job. But he'd wanted her. After seeing Victoria with the children, he knew that her methods were much better than the governess's strict controls.

"Good morning, Dharr," she said, stopping on the opposite side of his desk

"Good morning, Victoria|"Don't talk to your sister that way. Answer my question."

I glared at my Abby as she stuck her tongue out at me before replying, "We started dating a couple of weeks before prom."

She gulped before firing her next question. "Did you sleep together on the night of prom|But it felt like a step in the direction of secrecy just to dispose of the pages.
As soon as I got back to my room, I read over the remaining ten pages of the fax.  It was mostly the federal arrest warrant, which contained a lot of legal language that was difficult to wade through.  Of greater interest to me were the last two pages|That's when he tripped. He thought he had just caught his foot on some stubble, but when his hands hit the ground he could see the thin layer of earth cracking beneath him and the rock floor giving way under that. "It's another earthquake!" he thought.

But as the three-foot claw broke through the field and slammed within inches of his arm, he knew this was no earthquake|An ankh, the Egyptian symbol for "life."

Both of them knew this must be an important clue, another bread crumb on the path to discovering the true fate of their parents. It was why Jake had been researching Egyptian history, mythology, and writings so heavily. Now he realized that the symbol was more than a clue to their parents' fate|I don't know how he does it, especially when judging by the quiet dark, his father isn't home.

I turn off the car and flip the switch to keep the overhead light on and wait. He's the one who owes me an explanation so I refuse to have to be the one to start this conversation. After minutes of silence, he breaks it. "So, you hung out with him the other night, huh|Then he said with feeling, ‘Jina, I’m telling you, I don't want to lose her.’
‘Do you like her enough to risk what Vaxili will do to stop you?’ Sharma didn’t reply. He just tugged at an ear. Jina urged, ‘Come back to the real world, Sharma|"Maybe you're right" Regan rolled off of him and onto her own pillow, suddenly feeling petulant.

"Go to sleep, Regan, and dream of happy things. Dream of playing on the beach with Moira."

Heart rate jumping, Regan flipped back over and stared at him. "How did you know my sister's name was Moira|Simon pulled his hand from Peter's reach, watching with horror as the vampire's face started to shrivel. Peter opened his mouth to speak and as his tongue touched the roof of his mouth to make an utterance, Simon's consciousness flashed to the infirmary again. When he was back to normal, he saw that Peter's body lay completely withered and lifeless. He turned and ran back in the direction of the infirmary|Angus fumbled for an empty cigar box on the mantel and trapped the stunned wasp. A spark of excitement jumped through him. He’d take it to Vanora’s and examine it under her father’s microscope. Grinning, he slipped the box under his jacket and zipped it up. He’d never even been fast enough to catch a fly before, let alone a wasp|Thomas "Dragon" Anthony was a man who seemed to always put her on edge.

"If you're going to be working with the EOD," Thomas murmured as he lifted one dark eyebrow, "rough flights will be the least of your worries."

Noelle forced herself to take a long, deep breath. She didn't want to show any weakness in front of Thomas|Axel was on a roll and he didn’t want to stop talking.  He was getting to a point and then he wanted us out.  So I take a deep breath, deep breath in I calm myself…breath out and smile…ok.

“I’m McKenzie,” said the man. He reached out his free hand to Ana.
Ana hesitated for a moment, then shook McKenzie’s hand and said, “Ana.”
“Where are you from, Ana?”
“Look, if you are trying to pick up a girl, I am not it,” said Ana|But most of the time she was wrapped in Sawyer's arms and I needed the distraction Nicole provided.

"Nicole isn't very modest," I replied, trying to lay the blame on her.

The dimple I'd been fascinated with since the day I'd met Ashton appeared as she gave me a full smile.

"Nicole doesn't even know the definition of the word modest|"What happened next?"

"Sister Mattie asked about Bunson's. Professor Lefoux said something about them doing their best."

"I suppose that means Bunson's is trying to build a replacement prototype," Dimity suggested.

"Or a better-looking fake."

"I suspect we're heading in that direction, anyway," said Dimity|They might find out about the little secret cuts and start wondering what she'd seen.

She'd seen enough to know she had to hold on a little while longer.

All the cities bleeding because of the Controller. That was the future for the humans in Thaisia. There was only one person who might be able to change that future, and it wasn't the Controller|She squints one eye like she's sizing us up to be measured for wedding gowns.

"Yes," I say.

She looks at Amanda like I'm not even in the room. "Are you the man or the woman?"

"What?" Amanda and I say in unison.

"You know...tops and bottoms. Are you the top or the bottom, Amanda|"Not being a hickey expert, I wouldn't know for sure, but it would seem that way." She looked at Della. "So you weren't ever into it?"

Della let go of a low growl. "Okay, I might have been into it for a few seconds."

"It takes longer than a few seconds to get a hickey|“It was pleasure serving under you in World War II,” Shepherd said, and he felt his heart suddenly melt because it felt good to say something so apolitical and free from taint and true. His eyes teared up. It was so nice to not have to worry about impure things.
Eisenhower looked down at the man and put a hand on his shoulder. “Stiff lip before the camera, son – it was my honor to have you serve|Maybe Gavin thought he was marrying the ringleted temptress Elle had turned her into, rather than the real her. What would happen when he discovered he'd married a dull mouse rather than the exciting woman of his dreams?

"I love you, Bree." His whispered words banished her worries like a strong breeze.

"I love you, too, Gavin|After a while, Miracle turned off the road to cross a field that lay at the other end of her small subdivision.

"So, what are we doing here, Hardy?"

"What do you mean?"

Miracle stopped, closing her eyes and tipping her head back as she deeply inhaled the cool, lightly scented night air. When she exhaled, she looked up at Hardy|“You have no security cameras in a building where you house hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of art? Does that make sense to you?”
"Well, for crying out loud Detective, this is the Hamptons! We are not in the Bronx."
“Crimes are committed everywhere, even in the Hamptons|Across the street...
Two men in white uniforms and caps exited the black van, went to the rear of the vehicle, and opened the two back doors.

On the stoop...
“Yes, I’ve come to see Melissa,” Kat replied, feeling a bit unsettled around Stephanie; their meeting before and now seemed too much of a coincidence.
“Me too.”  Stephanie glanced up and down the street, spotted the van, and turned back to Kat|But from the set of his jaw, clearly he didn't intend to tell her.

"Then why did you kiss me?" To have that toe-curling moment tainted was just the final slap.

"Because I wanted to. I still do." He didn't lean in, but his fingers curved around hers until their hands were linked. The connection between them crackled all over again, even without the kiss|“My… my… name is Mandy. Ivy’s busy, so from now on, I’m your new algebra tutor.”
“What?” I growl angrily. 
This is stupid. I want Ivy. I don’t want this goldfish with asthma.

****

I’m currently storming around, or hobbling around in my case, like an idiot, looking for Ivy|I couldn't deny that I enjoyed it while it lasted though. I did. A lot.
"Yeah?" I asked my mom as I walked into the kitchen and snagged a handful of olives from the bowl she just uncovered when her back was turned.
"Did you eat some of these olives|"Doctor Neveeve -" began Vikus, and the woman literally jumped. A glass slide flew from her hand and shattered on the floor.

"Oh," said Dr. Neveeve in a breathy voice. "There goes yet another slide. Do not worry yourselves, it was free of contagion."

"Forgive me for startling you," said Vikus|'It's fun going to new places,' he said.

'New places!' shouted the Head of the Air Force. 'What the blazes d'you mean new places?'

'This place we're flying over now isn't in the atlas, is it?' the pilot said, grinning.

'You're darn right it isn't in the atlas|“Well, we have to make them listen,” Ethan looked at me intently, “Come with me after school. Help me convince Detective Dixon that he at least needs to look into Troy Matthews.”
“And, Jenna Martin,” I reminded him.
Ethan frowned, “Fine, if you give me Troy, I’ll give you Jenna|‘Our instructions stand the same, your Honour,’ William answered. ‘Any man is entitled to stop another man in the street and speak to him.’
‘Nobody denies that,’ Justice Bellworthy replied. ‘Do you intend to adopt the same tactics as in the past?’
‘It all depends on what you mean by tactics|"We sense only their broad feelings and not their concrete thoughts," said Ed. "Right now I sense hunger and eagerness."
"As do I," echoed Talking Owl. "Perhaps if we had more time we could do better."
"Why don't they answer us?" asked Mary.
"Maybe they're thinking things over like we are," said Ed|With it off, I teased my fingers across his flat, taut stomach and felt the cold metal button at the front of his jeans, and without warning, the gesture caused me to flash back to Calvin. To touching his body. His ghost stormed into my thoughts, and it was like he was right there, in the space with us.

Jude's mouth ground against mine, but I tore away, gasping for air. I couldn't do this. I couldn't kiss Jude and think of Calvin|“We were already thinking about that.”
Ruth, nodded. “Good. Good.” Then, to all of them, “This is my chance to get my message across, live, to the world.”
“It’s a gamble,” said Ananda.
“It is a gamble,” agreed Ruth|"The kelp passed him unmolested coming in here," Gallow said, smiling at Twisp. "Doesn't it appear likely that Nakano has immunity from the kelp?"

Twisp looked at Nakano, who once more stood passively at one side, obviously listening but not focusing his eyes on any of the speakers.

It came to Twisp then that Nakano did, indeed, belong to the kelp|"I'm sorry," he muttered turning back to her. "I wasn't thinking. I suppose we'll have to watch a movie downstairs and - "

"This is closer to Livy," she said with a shrug and moved nonchalantly to the love seat as if she'd hardly noticed the bed. But it was impossible not to notice the bed|She turned a cold gaze on the still-trembling Grolim. "Tell me," she said in a voice scarcely more than a whisper, "how is it that the one over there was permitted to come into my presence bearing a sword?" She pointed at Garion.

The Priest's face grew stricken. "Forgive me, Chabat," he stammered, "I-I failed to notice the sword|There, to her relief, she saw Peter standing outside, and Pater sitting inside.  She walked forward, and when Peter saw her, he waved.  She came up to him, her senses alert and questing for his demeanor, which told her everything was ok.  Peter was cool and positive.  Without speaking to him, she went into the small building and did the same with Pater|And find a safe place to hole up and stay there until I tell you otherwise. Don't make a move without me, got it?"

"Yes. I got it. Ana..." Frankie's voice broke. "It's all f**ked up. It all fell apart."

"That's usually what happens when you break the law, Frankie|She began fixing the pillows over the edge of the truck so that we could both find a comfortable position. "We're so overdressed for something like this," she commented.

"Who cares? We both look incredible."

"I'll never get used to how modest you are, Ben."

"People who look like me have no need of modesty|He knew that I was going home.

"I'm going home, remember? We talked about it after my parents left a few weeks ago. I told you that I couldn't wait to see them again at Thanksgiving."

He hesitated and he looked really nervous.

What is going on?

"I want to invite you home with me for Thanksgiving|"Did you ever hear of him bothering other girls-peeping, stalking, that sort of thing?"

"No, but I'm almost positive he was the one who sent me anonymous love letters. I can't imagine how he got the combination to my locker, but that was where he'd put them."

"What makes you think Oliver was behind the letters|Mari slipped the SQuare back into the satchel then gestured at the menacing door. "This is the HOC - Hystorian Operations Center. Are you two ready?"

Sera glanced over at Dak, who was actually smiling. Smiling. Maybe he'd survive his parents' disappearance after all. They both nodded at each other with knowing looks.

"We're ready," Sera said, right before Dak added his own confirmation:

"The Time Nerds are a go|Karen had no problem relaying what she'd been told. "Her parents weren't happy with the news of the baby. And they won't be involved from here on out."

Dr. Grayem shook her head and cussed under her breath. "If Rebecca needs a statement from me, call."

Dr. Grayem fished a business card from her pocket and handed it to Karen|The Simplification Movement wasn’t really an organized movement.  It was more of an ideological shift by a large number of believers.  There were quite a few Simpletons among the Mother Assembly denomination, but the High Sire had never recognized their movement as an order or organization.  However, some other denominations were founded on the principles of the Simplification Movement|This made some people all the more sure that something must have gone wrong with his head.
After the Bomont riders had all gone off in a cloud of dust and screeching chickens, the townsfolk saw Sheriff Mitch hitch up his horse and buggy and go over to Mrs. Gates' house.  Then the two of them left town heading in the opposite direction from that taken by Bomont and his riders|And he nodded and he said that Love was back in his life, and they offered their sincere congratulations and Jason whooped as usual and he said: can you feel the Love?   And Winnie hushed him but he kept whooping and Winnie finally said: Jason.  I feel the Love.  And Jason punched him gently and said: I know you do Winnie|“To make up for it,” said Ana, “I will work doubly hard as a mother. Deal?” She gave a bitter smile.
Ivan shook his head and said, “You still love him though, right?”
Ana didn’t answer.
“That’s what I meant by missing him,” said Ivan|The time before that, he gave me a brooch he made from brass gears and silver wire.  He was always tinkering.  Always.  He must have had a workshop.  I guarantee it."
Smith and Carter exchanged glances.  "This is excellent," Carter said.  "The cult may not know about the workshop|But the Primacy did not send complete fools to do its investigating and the Director must discover this soon.

"I wish to discuss my pet with you," Kelexel said, seating himself across from Fraffin without invitation. The desk was an enormous empty expanse separating them. A fault glistening reflection of Fraffin could be seen in its surface.

"There's something wrong with your pet|He closed his eyes and lowered his fist. Night insects were beginning to stir as he stuffed the shard into a pouch on his belt and jogged after Ava. He never felt the ice-blue eyes watching him, nor did he see the flash of silver wings take off from a distant peak.
The sun had nearly sunk behind the mountains when he caught up to Ava|"You want me to hunt whales?"

"No," said the Darkling. "I want you to hunt the sea whip."

We stared at him in shock. I almost laughed.

"You're looking for a dragon?" Mal said incredulously.

"The ice dragon," said the Darkling|"Happy birthday, Ryan."

"You remembered," he murmured.

"I've never forgotten. I baked a cake for your birthday every year you were gone."

He rested his forehead against hers and whispered softly, "Baby."

Fin closed her eyes. "I didn't know where you were, or what you were doing, but even if you weren't here, I wanted to make sure you had a cake|Did you get enough kisses to make up for getting your face slapped all over the news again?"

"No," I mumble. "I think Sarah turned us in."

"I think so, too," Sam says.

"And you!" Six spins around to raise her finger at Sam. "You went along with it! I thought you were smarter than that, Sam|This is where I really focused: “My heart doesn’t belong to that Jacob.” She then changed the subject, did she not? Yes, to her approaching birthday. Was that intentional? I wondered. More importantly was the single word she inserted in that ponderous statement: that. My heart doesn’t belong to that Jacob. True some people will say that before a name, such as ‘How about that Jacob|For an instant, I thought to go to him, offer him some small comfort, but tonight, for the first time that I could remember, I had none to give.

********

At nearly seven that night, I sat with Leah and her parents around their oval dinner table, listening to their family chatter. Their normal family chatter. It was the soothing balm my bruised and tender soul needed.

"But I thought you liked Johnny Depp," Dina was saying to Leah|By this time, there were ten children in the family, five boys and five girls. While in Jordan, my mother had given birth to two more children -- a boy Adnan, just shy of two years, and a girl -- Sarah, just a few months old. When she flew back, she came with only six kids; Jasmine, Salma, Sami, Abdul, Adnan and Sarah|I kneel so Maggie can slide off my back without too much stress on her leg.

"Don't call my best friend a dork, Kendra," Brian says.

Kendra puts her hand on her hip and flips her hair back. Oh, no. That's not a good sign. "Don't defend him. And he's not just your friend, Brian|I actually felt so unbelievably sad and started crying. I don’t know why I would cry! you said.  Ever since the dime story, we both found dimes everywhere. I found a dime in my pocket. You found one on the ground near the washing machine. In fact, to this day, every time I walk, I come across a dime|But then she realized that the phantom was not only burning. She was also laughing.

"You fool," the phantom said to Damon, in a soft and almost tender voice. "You think fire can hurt me? Jealousy can burn hotter than fire as wel as colder than ice. You of al people should know that, Damon|Peggy sat there looking bewildered.  She tried to look appreciative and smiled slightly, saying, “Yes, thank you guys.  You’ve done a lot for me.”  She paused for a moment.  “But I don’t really remember David and Marcie.”  She paused for another few seconds and continued, “But maybe the treatments have made me a little forgetful|"Careful," Colonel Martin calls.

"I know," I snap.

The glass ball makes a soft clink! when it touches the ground.

I step back. It rolls a few inches. Everyone gasps, but the ball stops as soon as it reaches level ground.

Once I'm behind a tree, Colonel Martin takes his handgun out of its holster and points it at the ball|What would it do? He took a hesitant step forward, reaching out. He paused, then touched the thing.

It shook violently, then fell to the ground, pasting itself to the floor like a chalk drawing. Joel stumbled back as the thing shot away underneath the altar.

Joel dropped to his knees, noticing a slit at the base of the altar|You know that Belsa are not sold.”
Georgianna turned, leaning across the gap between them. She grasped his arm, looking up at him, pleading.
“Beck, please.”
“Geor…”
“Why?” Georgianna cried. “I don’t understand!”
“Because I’m fighting a war, Georgianna|'I suppose mainly I came because of the witches,' she said. Christine turned, her eyes wide with fascination. So was her mouth. It was like looking at a rather pretty bowling ball. 'Witches?!' she breathed. 'Oh, yes,' said Agnes wearily. Yes. People were always fascinated by the idea of witches|I’m just trying to pay my bills.”
I suggest that he tell Eduardo that. But of course he never would.
“Do you like your job okay, though?” I’m almost afraid to ask: “Better than Customs?”
He thinks about it for a minute. “I don’t like it any worse,” he says, “but what I don’t like is how much more we’re struggling than we would be if I worked for Customs|She shook her head.
"Did she ever have you send things from the lab? Or deliver things?"
"She wanted monkeys.  But Robert said she hated the monkeys.  She hurt them.  So I didn't bring them."
Nella could see Ann becoming agitated.  "Okay Ann, we don't have to talk about the monkeys|She simply didn't see him in those terms. Besides, she had a boyfriend.

"I'd rather talk about Nate," she said, preferring to change the subject.

"I'd rather discuss Bruce," Teri countered.

"Why?"

Teri shrugged. "For one thing, I find him more interesting than Nate|They were really cool "villains" but why would they eat stars in the first place?  Next blog entry.

Dark Energy and the expansion of the Universe
 
In the original incarnation of VIRUS 5, all I had was the "villain" being the Stareaters.  It never occurred to me to ask why they wanted to eat stars|Or, to be more precise, she slumped down into her corset, which didn't allow for very much slumping. Then, after a moment's thought, she stood and left their room, heading for Sidheag and Agatha's.

Sidheag wasn't there, but Agatha let her in.

"Sophronia?"

"Could I have a little look out of your window, please, Agatha|"I do! Now!" and she reached for his hips to pull him into her, moving so that he fit her perfectly.

There were no more words for a long time, only cries of fulfillment as he felt her climax and came right after her. He was breathing heavily for a long time afterwards|By the time Richie returned the money, though, Red was fit to be tied and taking out his frustrations on the lightning bugs lazily flying around in his driveway. He had a two-by-four in his hand and showed no mercy to these inoffensive insects, which he whacked with unrestrained abandon and squashed with equal fervor on the driveway floor. The concrete grounds sparkled with crisscrossing but fast fading streaks of light—the flattened lightning bugs’ last gasps—as Red threatened to do the same thing to Richie|“Uh…It was nothing, nothing,” she said, turning and walking away from him.
“You can’t expect me to just walk away from that!”
“Basha!” Iibala yelled at him, turning back. “I just don’t think you should…” She sighed and stopped. “Do you really want to know, Basha|Racing for the parking lot, Justice found his car, started it up and chased down his errant wife.

Driving alongside her while she was muttering to herself and bristling with unleashed fury, he rolled down the passenger window and ordered, "Get in the car, Maggie."

"I don't need you, Justice|He cocked his head to the side thinking about it. "Without interruption? With the Royal Guard-"

"Not all of them." I shook my head.

"My Lady, crime rate is rising. There is no way I'm taking the Handmaiden of Phaedra across our land without an army."

"Stop calling me the Handmaiden of Phaedra|It wasn’t until the eleven o’clock service at the Romero Center that he finally snapped out of it. Their guest speaker had been Reverend Tom Dotson, a slightly overweight man in his forties wearing a black suit. At first Robert hadn’t been impressed. He looked like one of those preachers that yelled a lot and was constantly dabbing their forehead with a handkerchief. Robert wasn’t fond of being yelled at by anyone, including a preacher|'Your services will be required for the period of three months.'

I press my lips together. I was very drunk last night, but I am sure he said one month. 'Can I speak to him?'

'Of course.' He picks up the phone and speed dials his client's number. 'Mr. Barrington, Miss Bloom would like to have a word about the length of the contract|But I wonder just how far that cleverness has taken you and how far it could take you?

I m not sure I m following you,

I admitted.

You re freeing these Lost Souls for the purpose that they aren t supposed to be here.

Her hands curled around the armrests.

But tell me. Why not free your own soul?

I didn t realize it needed to be freed|“There’s another thing that I have to show you,” Hydra said as he pulled out a pouch. It contained all the disks that Elvira passed on to him before he escaped through the hole.
“This is real Hydra—so real,” said the awe-struck Pluggo.
“We have to go back to Genoa and retrieve the rest of the disks|Mom scurries to the group to help Tony take orders while I follow behind her with a pitcher, filling water glasses.

After I pour the water, Mom tells me to sit down at a booth. I pull out the Frommer's book on Spain from my purse and stare at it longingly. If only we were as rich as Kendra's parents, I'd be able to go to Spain|He hit the ground and dashed back the way he had come.

Have to think quickly, he told himself. Can't go to the dormitory. They'll just come under the doors. I have to find the policemen. They have acid.

Where were Harding's patrols? Joel ran with all his might toward the Rithmatic side of the campus|She contemplated turning around and finding an alternate route, but didn’t want to constantly change her routine in order to avoid three annoying girls.  So, she gathered up her strength and continued on.
It did not take Kayla long to notice that Bryn was in the same hallway.  She looked around to see if there were any teachers before saying, “Hey Bryn|"Please come in, Slavica," Natalya called out. "Can you get the door?"

"Yes, I have my key." Which was unusual. Slavica would never enter a guest's room uninvited. She would knock and expect the guest to open the door.

Natalya inhaled. Brent Barstow. She'd known all along he was something other than a guest|She is the center of my universe.”
The Ambassador chuckled. “Children would have it no other way.”
She kept her demeanor quiet, as he fiddled with the corners of his sleeves and shifted from foot to foot.
“There is something you wish, Ambassador?”
“Yes, well, it’s not a wish|I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, you’re cut out for this. Maybe it will take some time, but one day, we’ll get you,” he said with a smile.
Starr smiled back. Inwardly, Starr was starting to agree; she was cut out for the job. 
Today felt really good.
“Godfather, please,” Saul came up and sat next to Starr|"I don't know, Luxa. I think he made a pretty brave choice. And I think in his mind it was the only one he could have made," said Gregor.

"Perhaps. I do not know." Luxa gave her head a shake. "But would you have abandoned your family, Gregor|I could hear my own heartbeat the room was so silent. Toryn was moving. I watched him reach the instrumentalists, and he said something to them. Music filled the silence. They were playing a song that Trina played on her stereo all the time, a pop song about a gypsy.
As soon as I started singing the clan began smiling and even erupted with applause when I sang the part about being a gypsy|Sean swam down and grabbed me, clawing his way up my body until he had me around the middle. Underwater had to take the cake for the oddest werewolf-fighting locale of all time. Ultimately, Sean's goal was to drown me, but he needed to breathe as much as I did. Werewolves were supernatural, but they still had lungs|"Then later, when the committee tried to book another month, they ran into all kinds of roadblocks," Leanne explained. "So it was decided to keep the May date and to count our blessings."

That made sense.

An uncomfortable silence followed. I started to speak at the same time as Leanne|Indal inched aside to make room for her, and she sat gingerly, favoring her arm.
Carda knelt in front of her. "Are you okay?"
Xironi bit her lip and nodded. "Setting the joint was bad, but I made it." Her eyes lifted to the windows, then returned to Carda|“Let’s go!”
Maisie stared in horror as Mark and Janice sprinted past the zombie, who swung his arms at them, but missed. He turned back to Maisie. He brought his arms up to grab her. She got to her feet and threw herself between his legs. She crawled along the ground to put some distance between her and the zombie|As our crew got out of the van, another half-dozen people walked up to us, including a tall, forbidding man with twin scars across one cheek. I recognized Eduardo, Lucas's stepfather and quite possibly his least favorite person. His dark gaze embodied everything that frightened me about Black Cross. "I see this is the big emergency," he said, staring at me.

"You'd prefer another kind of emergency|She covered her mouth with her hand. "No! That's not possible!"

"It's the only way he could've known to warn me. What I'm trying to figure out is whether he's undercover or with them on his own." He hesitated. "His closest friend in the FBI says he isn't undercover|He flicked his lighter open, burning a string hanging from his black jeans.

So what happened back in Iceland?

I asked Alex, inching away from him and the fiery static.

Did you figure out if the Banshee was your mother?

Laylen pulled a face.

What the heck were you two doing in Iceland, with a Banshee|He'd never been nervous in front of cameras or out in a stadium playing in front of one hundred thousand screaming fans. So how could one curvy woman make it so hard for him to string more than two words together?

She tucked her legs beneath her and picked up the mug. Bringing the rim up to her lips, she took a sip, staring unabashedly at him over the mug|I thought about it later, the irony, while we were eating pasta and pumpkin pie and laughing, Trudy was trying to die. You told me I shouldn’t trust her: she’s strange you said. But, she was my friend. I really liked her before she changed. While you were hanging out with Susanne and a few older kids from the neighborhood, ignoring me, I hung out with Trudy|“Did anyone check the back of the building?” asked Captain Weatherspoon.
“I doubt it, the officers were more concerned with getting the residents out of the building,” said det. Johns.
“So someone could have slipped pass the police by leaving out the back way?” asked the Captain.
“Yeah, it’s possible,” said Johns|Simps yelled as he closed his eyes.  The limousine wheels screeched, but the driver wouldn't be able to stop. Shari ran at the boy and tackled him off the road in time to avoid the car. 
Rebecca ran up to the boy along with about fifty other kids. They all squandered along Simps, but Timothy ran past Simps to check on Shari|The King stabbed Damon’s mother though he did not anticipate that she would spin around and grab hold of his shoulders. She pulled the King down to his knees with surprising strength then sank her teeth into his neck. The King gasped as his knights rushed to his aid.
The knights managed to pull her away from the King|"No, that's not it."

I felt a sick lurch. "David?"

"He's - " David reeled, as if he'd been slapped, and crashed into a table that held a glittering display of crystal. He went down amid a shower of glass like falling stars. I threw myself onto my knees next to him, trying to think what kind of first aid I could do for a Djinn, and saw a sickening blackness bloom along the right side of his face, like fast-growing mold|Come on."

Halfway out the door, Brice said, "We can't leave her here, Jack. The crazies will get her."

Jack lost it. "If this woman is with Cole, she is an enemy! You can't trust her!"

"She's alive and still a human being, Jack|The man’s face looked positively cannibalistic, but Mercedes couldn’t look a gift horse in the salivating mouth. Their current funding would not streamline the process or get the devices out to the people of the world. 
“Absolutely, just give my intern a call, and we can set up a private appointment. Our contact information is on the support flier you received at the beginning of the presentation,” said Mercedes|The weekend after our movie night together, Marco had had plans. However, the following Monday he turned up at my door after work, carrying a bag of groceries and film rentals. He quickly set himself up in my kitchen and I watched in bemusement as he threw together homemade meatballs and spaghetti. I don't know why I was surprised that he could cook|“Expansive vocabulary you’ve got there.” His voice had come from behind me, and I heard a hint of amusement in it.  “You got a spare in that thing?”
“I certainly hope so,” I answered, not having a clue.
It turned out that I did have a spare|“You’ve got that a cute fringe skirt on again.”
“I like your scarf.  Where’d you get that?”
“Phoenix…”
“Okay, ladies.  Enough with the fashion parade.”
They turned around to see Dan coming through the ranch house.
Sarah gave him a big hug.
“It’s good to see you, Dan|Spike came off the porch, looming large as he approached. He walked right up to Myka, stopping maybe an inch from her, never mind about personal space.

Was it getting hard to breathe? No, Myka stood in the cool, fresh air, October in Austin dry and fine.

Jordan squirmed in her arms and pointed at Spike|There is a standing up, there is a lying flat, there is no falling motion, nor any time in which that motion could have—should have—occurred. Standing up, lying flat. That’s it. As if the falling had been edited out.
Most of the commentary, and most of the subsequent opinions, claim the footage simply had to have been edited|So long as we get super powers too.”
“So what are we wishing?” Ian asked, confused, “Does that mean we make five different wishes?”
“No,” Jackson said, “We have one wish that is five things at once.”
“Let’s do it then,” Jane said, “Jackson you make the wish|More beautiful every moment you know her, so happy and so delightful that the world is a better place for her having been born.”
George said, his throat tight and filled with tears, “I forgot you play to win.”
“I play to crush.”
“Even when it’s yourself you are crushing?”
She nodded her head, still holding tight to his hand, and said, “Even when it’s me I’m crushing|Their strategy was simple. They would try to slowly move the dragon away from the mountain range to allow a safe escape for the Rholians that remained in the Realm.
Palto turned to come at Phanthus from above. When he looked down he could not believe his eyes. It was Jayden riding on the back of the dragon|Emma exclaimed, looking up from the pile of clothes she had been searching through. “No! Of course not! We’ve just…become friends, I guess.” 
“Mmhmm.” Amy said knowingly. “He was certainly quick to jump to your defense when Morgan went all psycho ex-girlfriend on you.” Amy picked up another shirt and showed it to Emma|He'd been watching us and, for some reason, I got the feeling he was enjoying it, like he was mentally licking his lips and waiting for us to start peeling each other's clothes off.

But the most bothersome part was the smell. "Derek, I- he- there was a smell."

I saw the understanding in Derek's eyes even though he still asked, "What kind of smell|Jase is right, the sugar floods my system and perks me up the slightest bit. I finish the whole chocolate bar and drink half the soda as he takes over driving. We're getting close now - the GPS on my phone says only a couple more turns before we reach our final destination. It sounds ominous.

Jase is silent, but I can see him stealing glances at me from the corner of his eye as he drives|My mom met Max a few hours ago. Even medicated, like my mother claims she is, she should find it hard to trust a stranger. “Why did she give you her number?”
“She’s worried about you.”
“She’s delusional. She thinks I’m schizophrenic because she’s schizophrenic|Katie kept checking her phone and trying to fix her ponytail so it was just messy enough to show people that she didn't care. I mostly ignored them as Zack kept sliding his hand up her thigh and trying to feel her up. Either she was oblivious, or she was doing the best she could to ignore him. Judging by the stiff hold of her neck, she was doing the latter|Unease flickered across Kate’s face and settled in her eyes.
“ How did she take the news about that young girl found on her property?”
“ I haven’t had a chance to tell her. She was so worn out from her trip that we haven’t covered any details about anything. She’s going to set up another appointment as soon as she’s rested|A dog started barking.
"Get back!" a voice shouted. "Get off our land!"
"Now calm down, John, it's me, Doc Stewart. I brought a friend with me. I come by to check on your daddy."
There was silence for a second, then the voice called, "Oh, howdy Doc|"I'm cool with it as long as you are."

Pushing himself away from the table, he walks away from me and heads over to Damon. They talk for a second, then Caleb tosses his duffle in the back of the van and climbs inside.

"Caleb said you worked it out," Damon says to me when I limp over to the van|This world is changing and the window between worlds will be less seen in the future, or at least that is what I think.” 
Ice-Ghost looked around at the souls who had now gathered around them. Most of the souls were of dwarf size. Ice-Ghost asked Gloo if he thought that he would be able to help them find their owners. 
“I think they are the souls of friends, family and my clan,” responded Gloo|When I look up again, I see a bird swoop down from the roof of the train depot, dark as a shadow. It lands on a lamppost across the tracks, swivels its head toward me, caws. It's a crow. My heart starts to beat even faster.

"Caw," says the crow, testing me, taunting me, calling me to join him across the tracks|Oh, it was petty of her, she knew, to fault them for their infinite ambition when she was the one left filing papers-again-but Alice also knew without any doubt at all that each of them would happily stab the other in the back and trample all over the bleeding body to get ahead. Like some other people...

As she gathered up her papers and retreated to her attic, Alice wondered again how she could have been so wrong about Ella. Of all her friends, she would never have expected her to be the one to let her down-Cassie, in an episode of single-minded selfishness, perhaps; Flora, out of thoughtlessness; but Ella|She didn’t have any kids of her own.”  He stared down at the ground.  “She was wonderful to me.”  
Joel gave him a questioning look.  
“Yeah, she’s gone now.  That’s when I started looking for my dad.”
“And you’ve been looking for him ever since,” whispered Joel|I was only wondering.”
Seilo said nothing, but continued to shake his head.
“Just one last thing,” Tir said, careful not to scare him. “One more little question. Do you remember where you were when the hawk caught you?”
Seilo’s ears pricked, and he looked up at Tir|Earl and Lita were sitting on the opposite side of the tree, resting their heads against each other.
I guess having friends isn’t that bad, Dagdron thought, even though he knew he would never admit that to the others. He put his hood back on and tossed his dagger up into his tree.

“Hi, reader, this is Dagdron|“Oh, so more have been lost?” Ginger demanded.
“Well, there's one other one we're not certain about.”
“That would be batting a hundred!” Ginger exclaimed. “Well, at least you don't do things halfway., Half-assed, yes, for sure, but at least not halfway|I am curious about your newest council member, Ligoth. We stopped by to see the new development that he created and spent some time with him. We wanted to talk about timber allocations, but he seemed completely disinterested. Is he always so....nervy?'
'Ligoth is hard working and ambitious and is a great addition to the council|:
Ananda finally reached George Roth on the phone, an audibly upset George Roth who kept repeating that he had warned them.
“I know,” Ananda said for the third time. “I know.”
“It’s got CIA written all over it,” said Roth.
“But the State Department has issued a formal protest,” said Ananda.
“Of course they’ll protest,” said Roth|As the moon rose and its light filtered through the branches and leaves of the tree, the tiny golden star painted on the fingernail of her ring finger began to  
sparkle and wink...a reminder of the night sky.
     A sudden gust of wind tumbled the basket several feet from Karyn and swept several strands of her hair across her cheek and lips.
     Gem bent and replaced the basket, setting the almost empty wine bottle inside to hold it in place.
     " We can't spoil this lovely scene, can we Karyn|She couldn’t possibly play.
The committee left Jonesy with an ultimatum: a new approved piano player or a boycott.

* * *

Nell was hosting a small luncheon at the back of the academy when Jonesy turned up cap in hand asking her to play this afternoon.
‘Oh, Mr. Jones,’ said Nell|To what end?"

"Professor? Are you trying to hurt me by pretending to think I am a monster of naivete? I mentioned your psychohistory, which Demerzel wants."

"And I told you that it was a youthful indiscretion that came to nothing."

"You may tell me a great many things, Professor|by the tone of his voice, Ambrose made it clear that he didn't care to even know the individual.

"You didn't answer my question. You see, I'm looking for a new mistress, and I was wondering if you planned on keeping yours." His smug grin made Ambrose want to stab him where he stood.

"Mine? Obtuse idiot, I don't have a mistress|Her method had the additional advantage that if they were to take a cab she was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one obvious disadvantage.' 
'It puts her in the power of the cabman.' 
'Exactly.' 
'What a pity we did not get the number!' 
'My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not seriously imagine that I neglected to get the number|It's his sister we're worried about," said Ripred.

"What makes you so sure I'll be there?" asked Gregor.

"Because of that bat of yours. The big moody one," said Ripred.

"Ares?" said Gregor. "What's this got to do with Ares|Before Maji had even recovered from the tests, she felt the car slow down and turn off the main road that would have led them straight back to their own comfortable home.
The car pulled into a spot in the parking lot. She looked at the very fancy restaurant. Her stomach growled loudly.
"I'm hardly dressed for this..." She said.
"I'll leave a good tip." He said.
He led the way into the building and smiled at the hostess|"You think of everything, don't you?" I laugh.

"I try to," he says immodestly. "I get it from Dervish and our chess games. He's always nagging me to maximise my potential and use my brain more."

"What is it with him and chess|Amanda rotated the handle on her coffee cup to the opposite side.

"Do you want to talk about it?" she asked.

"No." Amanda's voice was flat.

"Is there anything I can do?"

"No," she said again.

"What's going on with you, Amanda|"Adrian-"

"No." The curve of his mouth straightened abruptly. "I won't make a tactical error because of my craving for you. My mission-and, most of all, you-are too important to risk."

The tightness that constricted her chest was fueled by respect. She had a sudden crazed desire to crawl all over him nak*d. "I have responsibilities, too, Adrian|That, and he'd made an obvious point of trying to pursue her ever since brunch. The long afternoon had stretched into early evening, with the holidays clearly making everyone relaxed. Around three p.m., Mason had broken out the margarita machine he'd received as a Christmas present from Shay, and now pretty much everyone was feeling a little bit toasty.

Jamie sprawled into a wicker chair beside her, draining the last of his margarita|This was a different kind of leap, and somehow it felt more dangerous. The stairway was crooked, the railing nothing more than a few boards haphazardly nailed together. I could've been staring down into the Sisters' dusty basement, which was always dark because they never let me replace the exposed bulb above the door. Except this wasn't a basement, and it didn't smell dusty|“Sure, Luca, anything.”
“I’d like you to call your Congressmen friends and find something out for me.”
“What would you like to know, Luca?”
“I heard that the Senate Appropriations Committee is preparing language to legalize drugs.”
“I heard something like that too, Luca|I stopped again when I heard the challenge in my grandma’s voice and turned back to peek around the corner. 
His tanned face flushed, and she stepped toe to toe with the young man. “No, none at all,” Ivan answered. 
“Good, because she’s off limits. You understand that, don’t you, Ivan|I probably would have looked for answers on my own, too. But you know what?"

He stopped, making sure that Miles was listening to him. "I wouldn't have believed the first story that came my way that promised an answer, especially if it was from a guy like Sims Addison. Think about who you're talking about here.Sims Addison|When they were gone she looked back toward the rover. She climbed in beside the crate knowing she could not spend another minute in that city much less the rest of her life. There was a slat in the ceiling through which she could see the glass dome of the roof.
She grew still when the men returned with the last crate|The back of his house was visible from where she stood, along with a few trees.  She could even see the long driveway and the black iron gate leading up to the house.  A winch had been bolted to the concrete slab he’d parked on when he’d brought her here.  She didn’t want to think about the purpose of the winch|Especially when the flowers arrived at the hospital-lilacs, her favorite. There hadn't been a card, just the flowers.

"You sure that you're okay?" He took her elbow and guided her to the couch.

She'd be better-less distracted-if he put on a shirt, but Gabrielle nodded. "I needed to thank you, both for finding me in that alley and for the flowers|"Your account has already been closed out, Mrs. Stevens." Diane shook her head. "No. There must be some mistake. I have-" The teller put the card in front of Diane. It read "Account closed. Reason:

Deceased." Diane stared at it unbelievingly, then looked up at the teller|He felt Samara's fingers entwine around his other hand and clasped her hand in his. Then he ducked his head to swipe his eyes on his sleeve. 
'Good griffin, clever griffin,' Samara said in an unsteady voice, standing on tip-toes, so she too could pet at Balkind's neck feathers. Alfred swayed on Balkind's other side, a slow smile spreading over his face as he gazed in wonder at the griffin|There was a gentle smile on her rubicund lips, her eyes were light brown and on her forehead was a crescent moon that contrasted with her dark hair.
News of the goddess spread quickly and soon a steady stream of Dryvellers visited the new attraction. None of the Dryvellers had heard of Diana before and it fell to Sycko to explain her significance in Dryvellism. For reasons Sycko didn’t understand Jeremiah seemed reluctant to face the visitors and talk about Diana|Well, he thought, I’d better get to the library.
~*~
Mike was smiling to himself as he hung up the phone and walked over to the owner who was standing at the counter drinking a cup of coffee. That ought to give Doc a little snap in his step, Mike thought.
“Be a package coming in tomorrow for me,” he said to the owner|Doyle nodded. "Yes, she did."

"What if it's somebody from the Seelie Court?" I said. "Would we have more trouble tracking it?"

"Perhaps."

"Are you saying that the traitor is Seelie?" Rhys asked.

"Maybe, or maybe we've got two traitors|I smiled, handing him the picture. Nothing like a little "incentive" to get a man focused.

Holding his breath, he settled the wire into the hook and let it hang. Stepping down from the step stool, he grabbed my hand and led me across the room.

Five steps later, he spun us around so we could take in the full effect of the picture|“Who paid off the note to my house?” Eloisa blurted.
A startled Chencha stared at her friend a few long seconds before answering. “Why would you think someone paid it off?” she murmured.
“I went over the figures on the mortgage to my house. Ralph lied. There was no mistake, and I’m pretty sure he didn’t forgive us five years’ worth of payments|We were good companions, and I enjoyed the sex and the hunting. But love? No." In the glare of the overhead security lights, which cast curious dark shadows in the corners of the lot, I watched Pam's face relax into its normal smooth lines. "I owe him my loyalty," Pam said. "I have to obey him, but I do it willingly|"That's not what you told me when you started the Stake-Out team. You said the Undead were dangerous, and this one has just proven it."

Mr. Holstein folded his arms over his chest. "If I was truly dangerous, none of you would be alive to talk about it. But as Mr. Whelan has discovered over the last few years, we are harmless|Cassie set her slice of pizza down and lifted her shirtsleeve to show Adam the new burn on the inside of her hand. "That wasn't there before I went to bed."

Adam closely examined the mark. "Okay, that's weird," he said. "Do you think you were reading the book in your sleep?"

Cassie pulled her sleeve back down and picked at a pineapple bit on top of her pizza|"This is something I've been thinking about for a long time." I put the journal on the table, shove it over to him. This might ultimately be my biggest betrayal of Kelsea. I feel awful, but then I conjure Rhiannon's voice in my ear, telling me I am doing the right thing.

Kelsea's father puts down the drumstick, picks up the journal|Oh gods,” she choked out.
And a card fluttered from a picture on the wall, gliding graceful and serene to lay face-up on the ground at his feet. Ace of Diamonds. Setzer stared down at the card with a blank look as Maria continued to cautiously move toward him. Then she stood in front of him, but he continued to stare at the card|He'd said as much to his mother, but she'd acted as if he'd just denounced Christianity and insisted that an office tree was important to some people. He figured she meant those in the office, because he hadn't met a cowboy yet who cared one way or the other. "I did," he said.

"Did you decorate it with the blue-and-silver balls I sent over last year?"

He couldn't remember what his housekeeper had put on the tree|"So we hopefully don't die finding it, then we bring it back and... what?"

"That is why we need the scroll, Kevin. The scroll will tell us." Samantha had a way of making everything seem simple even when it wasn't.

"What happens if Charlotte can't get the scroll|He was willing, they both understood there was no fu-ture, and he was giving her back something she had forgotten to give herself-respect.

Danny liked her for who she was, and so did she.

"You know you have a farmer's tan." She ran her hands over his hip. He was golden bronze from the waist up. Below that, he was like bleached cotton.

"Well, what an amazing coincidence, since I'm a farmer|Abby looked at her granddaughter who smiling at something Brian said and thought, What a stupid question. 
 “I’m good Gabby. I never go to bed early.”
 “Okay then,” Abby said getting up to leave, “It’s not a date,” she added with a wink. 
 “That’s too bad, this time I was thinking it was a date|"No shoes."

I wiggled my bare toes. "A nd I didn't want to be a majorette like A llison. I wanted to be drum major, like your brother. I didn't want to be the girl who glittered and danced in front of the band. I wanted to be the girl in charge of the band|Control travel of a ship like your mind controls you...walking."
"I don't get it."
"Your brain doesn't consciously think of a code to walk from here," he pointed to the desk, "to that couch over there. You just stand up and go."
"And you can do that with a ship|And it will be up to you and me to help us avoid such a war this time." He touched the photograph. "Somewhere in the zone the arbitraries have hidden a small flag. Two teams will enter the game zone to retrieve the flag, while the rest of the clansmen will bet on the outcome and enjoy their popcorn. Whoever touches the flag first will win and be ported out of the zone|It hadn't even occurred to me to question anything else about him-as if everything up to now was unquestionable and acceptable, part of an unwritten script we both followed.

"Flute." Luke pushed open the bathroom door and headed for one of the back exits.

"What are you competing in?"

"Oh, I'm not here to compete|Ricky paid no mind to the condition of the exterior of his service station except to occasionally scour the ground until it was smooth like the rest of the areas surface. 
"I will retrieve my exobike. Wait here until I return."
Ricky went around the building and came back pushing his exobike. 
"Sit on the latter half of the seat. I will sit in the front so I can steer|“Yeah!” he replies.
“OIL!” He knows.
“And freedom! Sometime they talkingk about to have the freedom!” Al-Rasheed leans his head even further toward Ra’ad in affirmation of what he’s saying. The wind noise is nearly unbearable. “You sayingk we got to havingk the freedom|“To guard these apples in my pocket, miss, so no one would steal them.”
With one hand the shaggy man held the apple, which he began eating, while with the other hand he pulled Toto out of his pocket and dropped him to the ground. Of course Toto made for Dorothy at once, barking joyfully at his release from the dark pocket|The moment he’d been told it was another girl, he’d known there would be no more children for him. Whether his countess survived or not.
He’d sat down at his desk and written. Come home, brother, I need you.
And George had come.
They might irritate each other no end but they were brothers|Expecting some delay in the searching of their homes, the families of the administration were surprised to find that their homes were clearly targeted, as if on a list. When the soldiers were about to enter the house, Étienne had taken the women to the cellar, telling them that he would protect them, while the other men remained upstairs. The soldiers made no attempt to search the cellar|The walls of the room were covered with antique maps, and at the center of the room stood a massive iron globe. Langdon eyed the huge metal sphere and began nodding slowly, and then more vigorously.

"This way," Langdon declared, dashing off toward the iron globe.

Robert! Sienna followed against her better judgment. The corridor clearly led deeper into the museum, away from the exit|Mais, non, you may set your mind at ease-it was a fish."

"Du poisson?"

"Oui, Monsieur, du mauvais poisson," said I. "The ship's officers were overcome with a sickness after having partaken of a fish that had turned against us. HMS Dauntless, distinguished in many a heroic battle, was brought down by a fish|"Yes," I said when I knew I should've said, No, I'm just kidding.

But I didn't say no, and now I'm stuck in this bet where if Camryn wins, I have to give her an hour-long massage for three straight nights. An hour is a long time for a massage|Midas gave a single, firm nod. “Same wage as everyone else. Enough to buy the things you need.”
“And what about my training?”
“There is no training.”
“But you said—”
Midas turned to face him, eyes set in a squint. He was a lot shorter than Michael, but when he narrowed his eyes and set his jaw like that, he could be intimidating|I’m sorry I’m being really silly right now.”
I am being stupid. I guess I had this fantasy in my head of my prince. I would be his first, and he would be mine. Of course we would live happily ever after. But I know that it is just a fantasy|:

In three steps, Big Tom strode from the saloon to the sheriff’s office.  “Sheriff Mitch!” he cried so loudly that he scared away an approaching thundercloud.  “Come on out and let’s fight|He quickly relaxes and stands up walking towards us. He holds out his hand to Ayden. Now it’s Ayden who looks confused. “I told my father how you looked out for me. He’s promised he will turn himself in once we get out.”

“You have no idea how thankful I am to you, Ayden|"If so, I'll eat my hat."

"You're afraid. Understandably so. But I assure you that if there is some kind of creature lurking here, I'm more capable of dispatching it than any policeman would be."

"That so?" asked Charlie.

"It is."

"What makes you think it's some kind of creature|But I think I’m also kind of looking forward to some structure to my life. I never thought I’d say that, but not having any type of schedule at all isn’t the paradise I thought it would be.”
“I know what you mean.”
“How do you do it? How do you deal with not having a schedule|It doesn't matter how well I'm playing, I've got to live with the fact that it's taking everything out of me just to get through every game. Then I've got Carole who I can't even begin to believe, but I can't afford not to."

"Go on," she said, softly|After the steady stream of invective coming from the cockpit throughout the landing, Merlin was simply happy to be on the ground and not moving.
“We're down. You can unbuckle now,” Johann said.
Merlin required Gunter's help with the buckles since his burnt hand was useless for the task.
Johann was the first one out, followed closely by Merlin|The day after her encounter with Mark Harris, she was in the models' dressing room, getting dressed, when three dozen roses arrived for her. The card read: Please forgive me for bothering you.

Mark Harris.

Kelly ripped up the card. "Send the flowers to the children's hospital." The next morning the wardrobe mistress came into the dressing room again, with a package.

"Some man left this for you, Kelly|"You can say that alright."

"Ready to be washed?"

Kendall nodded. Once Pam had her settled in the sink, head tipped backward, lukewarm water rinsing down her scalp, Kendall realized she had her chance to talk potential business without anyone overhearing. "I have a proposition for you, Pam|"You may enter, but remember to drink from the cup."

The heavy gates swung open and the birds dipped their heads in deference as I passed beneath them. Alexi followed directly on my heels. I could almost feel his glacial breath on my neck. Confused by the falcon's dictate, I turned to face Alexi|While we sat there, I thought about how my father used to go out of the living room and ask one of us to pick out a name and phone number in the directory, any name, any number, anywhere in the whole, thick book. We'd do this and shut the book. Father would come in and open the directory and find the very name that had been chosen. It always used to be amusing and mystifying to us but, because father had been so casual about it, we'd never assumed for a second that it was anything more than a trick|Then he said sombrely, ‘This is where I leave you. You’re on your own from now on.’ Zaliek jerked his thumb towards the escarpment and the rain-veiled plains beyond it. He said, ‘Your orders are to harass the Dornite supply lines. You’ll divide the unit into two sections. Each of you will command one of the sections|He paused and looked away, but not before she saw the pain streaking across his face. It was gone when Nicholas turned back, and his face was expressionless as he asked, "Why do you believe I'm innocent when I wasn't even sure about it myself?"

Jo stared at him, unsure she knew the answer herself|"No, Hot Dog called in this morning and said he'd been tasked out to DC again."

Zane's stomach began to churn as that news sank in. "Tasked out to DC" was Ty's way of covering when Richard Burns needed a job done. Burns had promised Ty months ago that he wouldn't call him again for one of those jobs|Petorous took a step or two away from the door before he whispered, "Privilege." The tension of the apothos flashed through his chest and head, but Petorous kept his composure. In an instant, he could clearly hear Gaent and Teria's voices.
 "...guy skipped out on his rent in one of the neighborhoods we've been checking on," said Teria|She put the belt on and watched him drive the car out of the parking lot.

"What are you in the mood for?" he asked.

"A juicy, cooked burger." Gabriel burst out laughing. He drove further in the city until they found a burger bar. She stayed in the truck while he went in to order|When their arms were full, Clint followed as Max quickly but carefully threaded his way back through the rubble to the front door.
They were halfway there when Max stopped and froze. Not realizing he'd stopped, Clint rammed headlong into his back. They both scrambled from the impact to keep their footing. "What the heck are you doing, Max|Add in the headaches, and it had been a rough few weeks physically.

Levi was waiting for me outside the door. "It's going to get colder when the sun goes down." He held out my black pea coat for me.

"Thanks." I let him help me into it. I wasn't surprised that he didn't bother with his own coat|Emma, as if she had been following the conversation after all, began to amble to one side of the patiently filing children. She appeared ready to leave the queue, a sickly, almost pleased grin on her otherwise downcast face.
An angel silently swooped forward. Her beatific smile was somehow at odds with the way she opened her arms and wings wide to gently corral Emma and edge her back into the queue|"My guess is, if he was here at all, it was probably more as a guide. Someone had to have shown those Jayhawkers where your brothers lived, and it could have been Septin."
"But you're still just guessing," Mollie reminded him. "All we've ever been able to do about Boone Septin is guess."
"But the man spoke his name, Mollie|How can I push if I can't feel myself pushing!" The only pushing I think I've managed to do were those words through my gritted teeth.

He smiles down at me and kisses my sweating forehead.

"You can do it," Dr. Ball says from in between my legs.

I close my eyes tight, grip Andrew's hand, and push|Persistent little guy.  I told him I wouldn’t let him through unless he got the mask from those rancher brothers,” he explains, shrugging in disbelief.  “Figured it would get him out of my hair for a while.  Not much of a conversationalist.”
“Why would the ranchers give him a mask|I tried to avoid staring at Toby for too long. He was wearing only a pair of swim trunks and seeing him without a shirt brought back memories. He must have been freezing.

He sat down directly across from me. "How's your ankle?"

"How'd you know about my ankle|Isabel peered at Tamsyn over the rims of her glasses. "I take it you find Ellis intimidating?"

"Well, yeah. Sort of." Tamsyn cleared her throat. "Interesting but intimidating."

"Now that's where you and I differ on the subject of Ellis Cutler," Isabel replied. "I find him very interesting but not at all intimidating|No Government vehicles were parked within sight of the Seizure Zone. About thirty minutes later, he received an SMS message that the first truck had cleared into the U.S. He could see it through binoculars behind a long line of cars and trucks.  It was beginning to accelerate and passed his location in less than a minute.
Tension grew as the responders braced for the second truck|Jay followed his lead and stuffed his two wax blobs in his own ears, muting the sound around him slightly.
“Hollie put the wax in your ears,” Broudie told.
“NO, THERE’S SOMETHING BLOCKING THE SIRENS SONG BUT IT’S GETTING WEAKER, YOU CAN TAKE OUT THE WAX FROM YOUR EARS!” Hollie screamed, ordering them to remove the wax|Angell turned away and saw her mother which was running towards the fire, holding a bucket. She thrown the water but the fire was more intense. Amira ran toward the sea but Angell stopped her.
“Mom! No! Calm down, this fire is not a natural one! It is only from flowers, let them burn|Let them go, and we'll leave."

"Lady Benedict will be informed that you're here. If she wants to see you, a meeting will be arranged-fully chaperoned, of course."

"You dare imply that I present some kind of danger?"

"I know you do. The only question is, how much of a danger|"You might be surprised," Noelle said as she lifted her chin. "I'm a lot stronger than you give me credit for being."

He laughed at that, the sound low and rough. "Oh, I know you're plenty strong. All of my agents are. I didn't keep the truth from you because I thought you were weak|He laughs at something in the movie, and I'm glad I've already seen it so I can figure out exactly what he's laughing at. Let's face it, I've seen this movie enough times that I could do a one-woman show and quote the entire thing.

For the next half hour, ninety percent of my attention is on Jett and the other ten percent is on the movie|The bitch was getting all the attention, and only leaving the scraps for me.  “So, you’re not a cop anymore?  What happened?”
John had no desire for small talk, so he remained quiet.
“Okay, I get it.  You’re paying to ask the questions, right?”  Monet understood a man’s to be in control, which was fine with her as long as she was paid|"We'd both be freezing our balls off. Literally."

Colin laughs. "You're not the one that ends up nak*d and wet."

"Yeah. I'm the one sitting on the side of a frozen lake for an hour while you're having all the fun."

Colin snorts at Jay's use of the word "fun|You're here now and that's all that matters."

I followed behind Amy, who was carrying the cake, while attempting to sing 'Happy Birthday', so that everyone else would join in. Finally, the chaos that filled the house, turned to give their full attention to the birthday girl. Her face lit up when she saw her cake|She could be an asset." James posited.

What was this? Tracy thought. This sounded like the Dark Ages, like the king of Spain should marry the princess of France to secure a treaty. This didn't sound like something that should happen at all.

"I'll keep it in mind, James|I have a bride to win.”
“What makes you think she’s waiting for you? She’s mourned husbands for less time than you’ve been gone.”
George rolled his shoulders. “If you don’t want a fight, you are going about it the wrong way.”
“It only stings because it’s true, George|“No, but we can still hear you perfectly,” she replied.
They looked through the hole in the floor and saw the safe lying on top of a pile of flattened barrels.  The water was a little murky in the hold, probably from the debris that was kicked up when the safe crashed to the floor.  They dropped through the hole and swam down toward the safe|“I know,” said Flannery.
“And we can only wake them one by one?” said Gabriel.
“I know of no other way,” said Flannery.

“Yes,” said Flannery, “Billions.”

“Did she notice anything else missing?” inquired Det. Johns.
“She never made it into the apartment.  She broke down at the door.  I had to go in to get her things,” said Vasquez|Gaent asked. Torret had said something, but it had been carried away by the noise in the room. In fact, for a moment the sounds were so loud that Gaent's ears rang. Professor Torret didn't repeat himself.
"What would you recommend? This is my first time eating here," said Torret|He wanted to scrape along the top. He wanted to make an indention. 
Uncle Ander opened his backpack. Inside, a small wooden box. He slid the off the lid. He emptied the ashes into the indention. He placed the shovel into the fresh dirt. He lifted it, dumping it over the ashes|I quipped hoping to ease her anxiety.

"Why am I here Leif?"

"Because you belong to me." I shouldn't have blurted it out like that. Bad timing.

She took a step toward me and a fierce expression had taken over her worried frown. "I don't belong to you, Leif|“We just gotta think how to get in…”

“FREEZE” says a voice. “Put your hands in the air and turn round!”

A wicked grin hits Tuckers face and he winks. “I think my question was answered.” He raises his hands in the air and we both turn to look at whose talking to us.

It’s a smallest man; he wouldn’t stand at chance with me and Tucker|"It's not that kind of test," Maria said, laughing. "I think they check for that anyway."

"Aw. Too bad." Scott grinned.

"I still don't see why she has to go," Jordan said. "Stay home and play with me, Maria|The Festival of the Happy Cats, by the way, was organized by the Emperor of all the Cats as a consolation for having to live with dogs.
They spend two days playing violent video games involving dogs and lions, they listen to cat rappers, they stuff themselves with hundred-year-old fish, and drink lots of catnip juice.
Then they stagger home and sleep for another year, until the next festival|Do you think Luke bought them and then got mad when I wouldn't move back in?"

"I don't know." Autumn looked equally mystified. "I don't think you should be with a man who has a temper like that, either."

"He didn't used to have a temper|Qu’est-ce qui se passe maintenant!?”
“Nothing dear!”
There’s a rap on the door and then it pops open. Madame Duguay’s got her hair tied up in a ‘kerchief and a broom in her hand. “Is he bugging you, Sarah? Because you just let me know if he’s bugging you...” She narrows her eyes at her husband and brandishes her broom|He hadn't meant to watch her do that, but he couldn't seem to keep himself from observing how the belt rode low and tight over her hips, exactly as the flight attendant would instruct them to fasten them during takeoff.

Emma had terrific hips, in his estimation. She had terrific everything. He'd hate to see even an ounce disappear from that curvy figure. Then he heard himself say, against al good judgment, "But you're perfect|Calibur, in despair, waded out as far as he dared; he could not swim. ‘Wait! I beg you, take this icon, if you will not take me, and give it to Rosa, and tell her I love her always, and wish her well. But I was not worthy of her.’ And a wave covered his head, but still he held out the icon|She didn't know if this was a normal loudspeaker notice, or if something was wrong with the train. She couldn't understand why the lights would be flickering uncontrollably or why the conductors tone would be so harsh. Either way, she knew she had to move quickly and get to the front car of the train.

She swung her backpack over her shoulders and gathered her sweatshirt and jacket and started running towards the front of the train|In Jenny's world, "I can give you head" meant "I like you a lot." And so, I took it as a compliment. Who doesn't like flattery?

At the same time, it stank of desperation and I didn't like it.

I said, "What makes you think I want head|Ronan held up his arm to show her the gauze bandage. "I'm fine. It just grazed me." A tiny bullet cutting across Ronan's triceps was nothing. He'd been shot with a Fae arrow last year--now that had hurt. The effing Fae spelled their arrows.

"You were jumping in front of bullets again, weren't you, Ronan|She spritzed some into the air and then stepped into the fruity mist. “Don’t worry about me. Everything is totally cool.”
Veronica studied her face. “He’s not some freak, is he? You know him pretty well?”
Melody smiled. “Of course, and he’s not a freak|She was even pushing at the boundaries Andra had set-a sure sign she was getting healthier, stronger.

At least, that was what Andra had thought.

The fact that Nika would resort to digging up their dead sister's bones proved just how wrong Andra had been.

"She really is crazy," said Andra|And the reaction from his mother was especially distressing.  Shelly had always been his anchor.  She was calm and rational.  She gave everyone the benefit of the doubt at least a dozen times.  But apparently that was for everyone except Belle.  Mal was still smarting from the phone call from Shelly.  He still couldn't believe the things she had said about Belle|9

I wait anxiously for Alex to return from his meeting with the Archbishop. The TV is on. The newscaster is speaking in French, but I am able to grasp the proceedings now.

The scene on the TV is one of marching protest. University students have taken to the streets against the Archbishop's declaration.

The newscaster, a dignified man in his fifties, says, "The streets of Moldavia have been turned into mayhem as protestors burn effigies of the Archbishop|"This is definitely my lucky day," Calvin declared.

Pandora looked oddly flustered. She turned hastily to Raine. "The usual? Olive and veggie?"

"Sounds good to me," Raine said, still trying to get used to the sight of a sparkling-eyed Pandora. "If that's okay with you, Calvin|My face is filled with rage, and the boy looks as though he will cry. Konrad locks eyes with me, but the boy's mother has her arms around him, admonishing, "Be careful, Dieter. Helena is pregnant."

Helena straightens in the chair and reaches for the boy. "It's ok, give me your hand, Dieter|No one will stop you."

"They might."

"No, they won't. You're free to do as you like here as long as you're not planning to hurt anyone."

Lexi shifted in her seat and her eyes darted away from Helen's.

"You're not planning to hurt anyone, are you, Lexi|How was your day?”
I reiterated my capturing of Reiss and Vincent on my camera.  Jackie gasped when I told her about sneaking into Professor Vincent’s office and what I found.  “We need to find what that Detective Reiss is up to,” I said.
“I guess we could follow him,” said Jackie|You see I feel remorse that I shot the man who forgot to fill up with enough fuel and made us stop at this little hole of a diner, but look at my good fortune! Chase Darkstaar, back from the dead!”
“Erm,” said Jason. 
“Five years. Five long years, but here you are at last. What a turn up for the books, hey, Chase|She'd had to defend her new business to her older brother, and she wasn't going to do the same with Dave's ex-friend. Which reminded her of the fact that Dave and Lucas weren't even speaking anymore. So why was Lucas talking to her now?

She pushed windblown hair off her face and asked, "Was there something you wanted, Lucas|...skull intact encircled with layers of tape, dark hair of approximately one inch in length embedded in adhesive...

...encircled with layers of tape, dark hair of approximately one inch in length embedded in adhesive...

...dark hair of approximately one inch in length embedded in adhesive...

"You're right. This sounds like the baby that the coroner examined had at least some hair|I open my mouth to say yes, because I'm excited to see it too.

But then I look down at my pink dress and white shoes and shut my mouth.

"I... uh." I want to tell her how I'm not supposed to get dirty, that ladies don't belong in the woods.

But I don't want her to think I'm saying she's not a lady|I left my old boots behind, figuring to get the newer ones that I saw me wearing in the Cube. I saw my image inside coming towards me. 
Suddenly, I was being pulled towards the Cube, hard. But instead of hitting against it, I just got pulled right into it and through the surface of it, into my other self!
Then there I was, sort of waking up as I stood a few feet from the Cube|The army of undead just stood there behind him grinning, some licking their lips as they waited for their chance to attack their next victims as soon as they got the go. 
Joe spoke again.  “I had entered the Underground here, in this very same well twenty years ago.  This is the well where we had opened our very own portal.” 
“I’ve already been told,” said Charlie. 
Joe’s eyes went from the well back up to Charlie|Despite it being so close to the college, I've never been here. He keeps looking around as we drive down the main street, all the while muttering to himself.

"Aha!" he exclaims, yanking the car over onto a side street and then pulling into a parking lot. I look at the brick building next to the lot|"I don't understand you," she cried, nearly hysterical. "I've cheated you and lied to you. Why do you still want me? You should be glad to be rid of me."

"You are my wife."

It demanded all of Julia's energy just to hold up her head. This man confused her and she lacked the resources to go on arguing|He was the elusive mysterious man everyone talked about in hushed tones.

And they were to be married.

She should be happy; she was going to marry Ash, after all. But happiness was the farthest thing from her mind.

He had lied to her!

She was willing to give up everything for him, and he'd lied|Papa, for once I'm not a disappointment."

Rowan scowled and Mari wished she could call back the words that had somehow slipped free. But she felt the weight of the knowledge all the same. The frustration of never measuring up to her parents' expectations.

"Mari, dear," her father said, his voice hoarse, "you have never been a disappointment|I can't prove it, but I'm sure of it anyway. But he did make certain we all walked the straight and narrow, which except for Roman's foray into women's underwear wasn't all that hard."

"What!?!"

Rick grinned. "Roman played the ultimate prank. When he was sixteen he stole a girl's underwear|Her killer is on death row."

"What are you afraid to tell me?"

Flannery didn't answer right away. Tyrese again peeled himself off the wall. He moved closer to the desk. Flannery watched him and surprised me with a tired sigh. "Do me a favor," he said to Tyrese|“Izzy and Hugo are worried, too. For that matter, heck, so am I.”
Rory nodded in acknowledgement, and then his amethyst eyes fell on my wolf companion. “So you have a familiar?” Rory gave Cheeva an assessing stare.
“I’m a girl, Rory. I’m not supposed to have a familiar|But I know you don’t mean it.’
‘In any case, we have more important things to consider.’ Said Jack, pushing his hand away.
‘What to do with the habitat and what our next step is going to be?’
‘That’s more or less right. Although I already know what I’m going to do with the habitat|Before Rex could continue, Jhahnahkan asked, “This planet, what do you call it, and what system are you in?”
“Well, now, son,” Rex started, “I guess you must have hit your head harder than we first thought.”
Jhahnahkan interrupted Rex once more, “I am sorry, Rex|I am missing my chance to see a man made in the Lord's own image!” Delilah giggled.
“Why do you say that?”  I asked as I abruptly opened the door.
“Say what?” she teased raising her brow at me.
“What you just said about the Lord’s image|They couldn't fight the Bane trapped up against this wall. They needed room to maneuver.

"But my sisters -!" Gregor began. Then he knew he had to let them go. To trust Ripred and the humans and bats who had flown in to save them. Because wherever Gregor was now, so was the Bane|She smoked to a stop in front of me, eyeing me over with such disapproval I looked down to make sure I didn't have some huge stain on my shirt. "Did you hear about the Betrothal Ball we will be hosting here next Saturday?"

"The Betrothal Ball?" I questioned, lifting my eyes back to hers once I was certain my shirt was stain-free.

A smile pulled at her lips. "Every so often, the Immortals of each Alliance are called together for an event known as the Betrothal Ball|Great-aunt Maddy might be a bit talkative and inclined to say everything four times over, but I liked that a lot better than the mysterious way the others carried on. And Great-aunt Maddy was always very generous when it came to handing out sherbet lemons.

But of course Charlotte didn't like sweets.

We crossed the road and hurried on along the pavement.

"Don't keep glancing at me sideways like that," said Charlotte|A few he had to spell, their foreignness uncomfortable on the ear and tongue. Two of the names I already had on my list. It was with those two and four others that I heard sadness change Colin’s voice. He had known these people. I turned to him and held his eyes for a short moment. “I’m sorry about this, Colin|"The holidays in New York are amazing," he admitted as he turned back to the lights.
He felt her get closer to him and take his arm in hers.
"It is so cold out here," she said.
"I like the cold."
She put her head on his shoulder, facing the lights|He inherited the house right down the road from you a year or so ago.”
“Nathan Kyler?”
“That's him. His grandmother used to live there. Her name was Ida Mae Chesney. She used to attend your church ‘bout twelve or thirteen years ago.”
“I’ve noticed a few Chesneys buried up in that cemetery|Admiral Hafer wanted to ask how I'd retrieved the prisoner so badly the question trembled on his lips, but Tony already informed him it was top secret and Hafer didn't have clearance.

"Have you performed any other feats of bravery?" The Admiral attempted a different tactic.

"None that I can discuss," I replied.

"I told you she was on loan and you don't have clearance|Sunny was so damned convincing... "Why would she think you're dead?" he demanded. "You might just be in a place that doesn't have a signal - like here. What is she, some kind of nutcase?"

"I make certain I'm always somewhere that has a signal. And, no, she isn't a nutcase|'Tell me, Mary,' she said, 'tell me quite truthful y, is there really a little girl sitting on my window-sill, or am I still dreaming?'

'She is sitting there all right, ma'am, as clear as daylight, but heaven only knows how she got there! Your Majesty is certainly not dreaming it this time!'

'But that's exactly what I did dream|That was what made him so terrible, and so sad. The earl fumbled on the shelves, moving pens and pipes and peashooters, little gargoyles and dead leaves. Then, like an aged cat stumbling on a mouse, he seized a small, rolled-up scroll, and handed it to the girl. "Here y'go, lassie," said the earl|He forced himself to think clearly, struggling to keep from getting flustered. "North," he said at last. "Due north from here, heading up Aurora Boulevard."

"That would be in the direction of Government Tower?" the deferential robot voice asked.

Pallichan looked up the avenue and saw the tower|We had been at the Portland Children's Museum for two hours; I was beyond ready to leave.  The absolute chaos from hoards of kids was more than I could take.  I was at my breaking point.  My temples pulsated rapidly.
How about we go shopping now?" Doug offered.
Hailey pouted, for she disliked shopping and wanted to stay at the museum|I stood back and let you have Sheila, but I will not stand aside this time!”  George slid his hand deeper into his pocket, gently caressing the gun with the coolness of the metal giving him strength.
“I’m not trying to steal anything from you.  Have you lost your mind, George?  I have no idea where this idea came from, but it’s crazy|Something in her eyes made him desperate, made him realize that even when they were standing in front of each other, Velvet had never been so far from him as she was now. "I love you, Vel-" Mykolas' voice trailed off when Velvet shot him a look of despair.

"You don't get to say that, Mykolas|Unfortunately, it was a short walk and no sooner had they gotten into a good stride in their conversation then they had arrived at the doorway to her Biology class.

“I’ll see you tonight. How about six o’clock?” he asked.

“Sounds great,” she said, her face a little blushed as well.

They said their goodbyes and Jennifer disappeared into one of the classrooms|NOW, LET US TRY THIS AGAIN... He produced a tuning fork from the shadowy recesses of his robe and twanged it on the side of his scythe. THERE'S YOUR NOTE... 'Uh-uh,' said the swan, shaking its head. WHY MAKE IT DIFFICULT? 'I like it here,' said the swan|"I wasn't using you, Violet."

"Then what were you doing? You've never acted like that before."

"I didn't realize it would bother you."

"It bothers me because you did it as part of your show."

"Trust me. That had absolutely nothing to do with my show|If what Duncan saw through the Eye was real, then the entire planet was at risk.

Her eyes drifted to the box on the table. Before departing Ulan Bator, she had sealed the Eye in a makeshift Faraday cage, a box wrapped in copper wiring, to insulate its electromagnetic radiation from interfering with the jet's electronics. Passing his hands over the box, Duncan had confirmed that her efforts had indeed bottled up the worst of the radiation|How was I supposed to put Noah's mind at ease, when I feared the same fate? "No!"

He shook his head and started crying louder. "This is all my fault. I made her sad and she got sick."

I reached over and shook him gently. "Noah, this had nothin' to do with you. People don't get cancer because they're sad|You took a great interest in the words written above my chair.”
“Yes, Sir. They’re the same words written on the banner held in the statue’s hand in the courtyard.”
He smiled and turned back to her. “That’s correct, Keryn. Do you mind if I call you Keryn|"Nim? Human form."

His demon pulled out from under his collar to take the form of a small adult male. The instant he saw Simi, he ran and tripped.

"Nim!" Jared snapped. "She won't harm you."

Nim looked less than convinced as he crawled on the ground to the other side of Jared|And every day that passes, by not saying anything, I'm the one telling that lie.

God, Isaac looks so much like his father, Trajan. I see Sibyl in him too, though I would never tell him that because he would take it as an insult, even though Sibyl is beautiful. Malevolent and murderous beyond imagining, but still beautiful|Guts decided to quit that, too, one day when his cousin followed him and stood at the corner of the barn watching him.  He couldn’t explain the odd feeling which overcame him, but it was enough to make him give it up altogether.  That happened several weeks ago.  Now, he no longer had any desire to smoke.
One day while riding home from the mill with his uncle, Dean asked, “Why don’t you smoke|“Your barbarian friend’s enthusiasm is commendable, however I believe he underestimates the voracity and size of this enemy.” With this the wolf stepped down and trotted out of the cave, while the other members nervously followed him.
    The blizzard had completely cleared to reveal an artic plain beneath them, a mountain behind them and mountains all the way towards the horizon left and right. The white plain would usually just contain the great hole created all those centuries ago, and a lot of snow|There were seven new e-mails. The subject bar read, “I thought you might need these.”  All the e-mails came from the same person.  Katrina clicked the first e-mail and opened the attachment.  The word document opened to reveal the paper she was working on at the library.
“It’s the paper I was working on at the library,” said Katrina|An open window over his head brought in the fresh breeze from the garden, gently billowing the draperies and carrying the scent of summertime flowers.  He sat up slowly, and immediately Olivia parted the curtains and sat beside him, handing him a glass of water.
“Where am I?” he said.
“I know you must have many questions,” said Olivia|The door whooshed open, and we came face to face with a newly turned vampire and Tristan, who shot a very annoyed look my way. His hand shot out and stopped the doors from closing. Realizing that the clerk was looking between the two of us, I stepped into the elevator. Jayr hit the close button and turned to the new vampire|He said, letting go of her hands. "I am in need of an assistant. Mine has been, well, let's say disposed of."
Maji held her tongue.
"You will run his errands for me and occasionally assist me with my own errands."
Maji wondered how hard it would be to disappear on one of these errands|He unwraps a candy and pops it in his mouth. Then he holds another out to me. I can't even pick it up with my heavy glove.

"I'll get it." He unwraps the candy and leans toward me. I try to swipe my hair out of my face.

"Open up," he says, holding up the candy|As I pushed the box back under the edge of the bedspread till I could think of a way to get it out of the apartment surreptitiously, I found myself wondering if Jack had ever used such items. I was embarrassed at the thought of asking him, to my astonishment. I hadn't realized there was anything we could say or do between us that would be embarrassing|Connor stepped in front of her and whispered, Ye need to blow.

Blow? She took a deep breath and blew air toward her nose.

His mouth twitched. He took the tissue from her hand and placed it over her nose. Blow out yer nose, lass.

She replaced his hands with her own and blew|"Am I going to see my littliest, ittliest snickerdoodliest girl being a star of the parade?  You'd like that wouldn't you, Stephanie?"
Stephanie's eyes opened wide.  "Yeah, sure."  She was surprised that Grandpa Drummond wanted her to be a star of the parade.  She would have to think of some exciting things to do in order to be considered a star|“Happy to comply,” I said.
“So, you’re Ben. Ben what?” 
“No, I’m Matt…Matt Casale. I live down the street.”
“Wasn’t he just calling you ‘Ben’ just now?”
“No, ‘Bean’—it’s a nickname|Gregor could feel himself beginning to lose consciousness. Black specks swam around in front of his eyes. As the vine tightened one final notch he coughed. His bubble gum flew out of his mouth and into the pod. Stretchy, sticky lines of pink spun up in his vision. He was vaguely aware that the gum was doing something in the pod|'Well,' she said, smiling a little, 'it's freezing in here so I think I'll get under the covers.'

He watched in a sort of dazed incredulity as she got in the bed and scooted to one side, pulling the duvet up to her chin. She looked so right there, he thought, in his bed. That was the most incredible thing of all.

'There's plenty of room,' she told him, her expression almost mischievous over the edge of the duvet|He disappears into the kitchen and Nicole takes a few moments to dry her eyes and blow her nose with tissue from the box on the table. Her hands are still shaky, but she pushes through and calls Helen's number.

The phone is answered after only one ring. "Hello, this is Helen. What's the news?"

"Hey, Helen, this is Nicole|“They couldn't have,” LePage answered.  “Not with a dozen men.  But it's possible they unloaded it after it was ruined by the water.”
“Were there any identifying marks on the explosives?” Rousseau asked.
“None that I noted,” LePage said.  There had been little time to examine the contents of the crates he opened in the hold, but he would have noticed any labels that could have identified the source of the explosives|“I’d like to exchange, please,” said Hugo. 
“You’re not playing anymore?”, the croupier was surprised. 
“For the moment, no,” 
The croupier exchange the red chips to about a dozen one hundred Euro ones, and we left the casino. 
“Now we’ll talk,” said Hugo|"Do you have any idea where the circus will set up?" I asked as we ate.
Sacha shrugged, and looked to her mother to answer. "The only place I ever saw one was in Sokolniki Park," the older woman replied.
"Is that far from here?" I enquired.
"It's north of the river, you could probably get a tram," suggested Sacha|"We blew past the operating system password," Javier said. "It wasn't that hard.

Virtually all laptops made in the last few years contain Firewire ports."

Mack scowled at him. "I'll take back the coffee if you don't speak English."

Javier shrugged and grinned. "One of those 'holes' you can plug cables into along one of the sides of the laptop|Ives hopped in deftly, after giving the boat a strong, hard push. The pilot started the outboard and we headed out to sea. The boat was bobbing and weaving madly. I was holding on for dear life, unable to fathom how anyone could earn a living doing something as dangerous as this.
We talked amongst each other, huddled together in the middle of the boat|A meaningful death is the best any of us can hope for in life."

That was the saddest thing Helen had ever heard a child say, and she had to fight to keep from pulling Sibyl into her arms to comfort her. Only the worry that it would hurt her allowed Helen to hold herself back. "If you ever want to talk, or if you ever need a friend to just listen, I can do that for you, Sibyl|"Can't hurt, I suppose. Take her away."

Renna stepped in front of her bounty. "I don't think so. Money first. You know how this works, handsome." She gave him a sweet smile and let her gaze sweep the bunker's entryway. There was a small room off the entrance she guessed was the security room, and another a bit farther in that probably led into the main body of the bunker|He sat on the ledge, near her but not too close, and motioned at his still-chained ankle. "Wrong lot, I guess."

"I guess so." She tugged the manacle on her wrist, managing to slide it up about a centimeter. The skin on her wrist was more elastic than normal tissue, not a lot, but enough so she could drag it out from under the manacle|She never touched me, but I could feel her breath on my neck and I shuddered. She circled around the grave and faced me from the other side.

"What-what are you doing here?" I gasped, fear crawling up my legs.

"What are you going to do now?" she asked, walking to and leaning against a tall tree at the corner of the grave|You are to go to the commander's tent for further instructions,” Tiacotl told him.
“Yes, ma'am,” answered the guard and he ran off towards the camp.
When he had vanished into the night, Zinzabad joined Tiacotl as she undid the rope gate to the corral.
Ocelotl's black stallion was tied up at the front of the corral|Not unexpectedly, I didn't like them.

"Hey!" Ren called out as the two's swagger slowed down. "What's up, Matt, my man?"

Matt shoved his hands in the pockets of his cargo shorts. "Nothing much-you?"

Ren glanced at Stimpy, then back to Matt|I turned on the light in the bathroom and stared at the beaten and bruised reflection looking back at me; most of my skin was a muted shade of purple or green, like a bruise fading on the surface. I ran my fingers down the length of both of my arms and across my collarbone. Cool water on my face and hands didn’t make the bruises go away and didn’t make me wake up for real.
The bruises were here to stay; they were real|Everyone should eat this for breakfast. Every day. It's the breakfast of champions." She shovels another bunch of fluffy pancakes into her mouth. A bead of syrup runs from the corner of her mouth.

"That's Wheaties. And you're looking a little vampy, there." I touch to corner of my mouth and tilt my head toward her and say, "You've got syrup|His words were choppy in his excitement.
Sarah's face lit up, and she dropped what she was doing, and grabbed the phone from my hand. She punched the numbers as fast as she could and placed the phone to her ear.
“Put it on speaker!” Alex said.
She took the phone away from her ear, placed it on speaker|You said that in front of everyone."

"But I told you, I came to you in the night and told you I would - "

"You told me that you loved me as much as you were able," I said, almost bouncing on the balls of my feet in agitation. "It seems pretty clear that you're not able|"'To Jeff,'" he read, "'with love on our first Christmas. You are a wonderful husband and an amazing father.'"

I bit my lip, watching him process the meaning of the engraving.

He glanced at me, his eyes wide. "Husband and father?" He rubbed his thumb over the writing on the back of the watch|There was a gentle smile on her rubicund lips, her eyes were light brown and on her forehead was a crescent moon that contrasted with her dark hair.
News of the goddess spread quickly and soon a steady stream of Dryvellers visited the new attraction. None of the Dryvellers had heard of Diana before and it fell to Sycko to explain her significance in Dryvellism. For reasons Sycko didn’t understand Jeremiah seemed reluctant to face the visitors and talk about Diana|Chloe flicked a threatening glance at her sister. Alexie caught the look and mouthed "What?" Chloe turned to her cake again and kept her head down.

"Thank you, Alexie," Winifred said. "I hope the publicity generates more donations for the medical center."

"I thought the reporter planned to interview only the soldier, you and Chloe|Winnie said no just some fireworks and she nodded and said I heard them.
Winnie still felt some darkness shrouding her, and as he looked he noticed the engagement ring on her finger, and saw now the cold glinting diamond for what it was and he said gently: Isabelle.  You need to leave something behind. He reached for her left hand very gently, and as she started to pull back he said:  I need you to trust me Isabelle|"Wait. Something's wrong."

"What is it?" Riq asked. Dak seemed to be daydreaming about his potential role in history.

"I clicked on the 'Identify Break' option, and look what happened."

Data Corrupted

Return to previous menu?

"That's not good," said Riq|Ares dove down and plucked a pair of children from a wagon just as their mother had her throat torn open. He brought them to the balcony of the High Hall and set them gently down. They huddled together shaking and weeping, until someone came and took them inside. The entire hall was filled with bats delivering people and then jetting off again.

"Gregor, I must leave you," said Ares|My head felt as if someone had stuffed it, mounted it, and used it for batting practice.

Mom, the image in Cherise's memory had said. Mom. David had said that we had a child. I hadn't expected her to be...adult. And look so much like me.

Imara.

"She's alive," he said, and for a crazy second I thought he meant Imara, but he was focused on Cherise|She’s telling you not to leave her here to die,” Rolce said as he shifted his eyes to the pack around them. Gisbo looked at the white wolf cub.
“Tell her not to worry, I won’t let ‘em hurt her,” Gisbo said.
“Remember, she can hear you, Gisbo|Your laws say that you cannot marry outside the Atlantean borders. I couldn’t even become a citizen according to your laws.”
Ryeland says, “I have enough pull to make it happen. You will be the first.”
Palexus responds, “My father will not let me go. Atlantis is doomed. If Ladonea enters the war, I will die and so will you, if we go to Atlantis|Then, as we resumed our trek to the book she turned to us and said, “You know I’ve actually been thinking about taking a good solid look at this book for a long time. Almost as long as I’ve worked here. That’s almost thirty years now. But something always seems to come up. Isn’t that weird?”
“Yeah,” Trent said. “Pretty weird.” And it got weirder by the minute.
When she finally found the book she picked it up to hand it to Trent|It was difficult to believe someone could accomplish so little and still manage to hang on to a job.

"Hate to disappoint you, but I'll be lucky to speak with her. She's only peripherally involved."

"Too bad."

Mike didn't move on, so David rolled away from his desk. "Something I can do for you, Mike|They’re the only reason my parents are actually letting me come back.  My dad threatened to hire me a body guard.  If they knew you were placed in a safe house, they’d never let me return,” said Allison.
“Are you going to tell them?” asked Katrina.
“Of course not, I’ll be fine with Ron and Gary,” said Allison|She put a clump of wet sand on his head and he stopped moving. She leaned in and kissed him, and Miles watched his lips form the words: "I love you, Mommy."

"I love you, too," she mouthed in return. Knowing Jonah would sit quietly for a few minutes, Missy turned her attention to Miles|Now if there's one thing caymans really love it's popcorn. The little ones were heart-broken; everyone in the drive-in could hear their sobbing. 
It was at this point in time that the Hippopotamus of Fate stepped in. 
Some people might say it was just a coincidence. They don't believe in the Hippopotamus of Fate|Eventually, we reached a high desk, and as Monty predicted, I was asked to show my ID.

The man at the desk smiled at me when he handed back the card. "Enjoy your trip, ma'am."

"Thank you."

Kevin placed his bag on a moving belt. He stepped through a small arch. I went next, and we each grabbed our packs from the other end of the belt|Dang, couldn’t he at least make eye contact? Aren’t police officers supposed to have People skills? Geesh, I was more than a person who just broke the law by speeding. I was a woman.
I reached over to my glove compartment and pulled out my proof of registration. 
I looked through my purse and found my license|I knew what needed to be done but it was just not an option I really liked.
“I need you to blow up this town.”
“What?” Kelly asked.
“You heard me,” I replied.
“You can’t be serious.”
“I’m very serious. This entire town is populated with werewolves.”
“I still can’t just take out a town|To control who has and doesn't have magic, and when they get to use it? How is that possibly fair?"

"Hey, we're all in the same boat," Paul said. "It's not like you're the only one with troubles."

"Oh, I am well aware of that, Paul|Forrest worked with them every morning. I just don't understand this one."

"I thought you are an ex-addict."

Meave was shaking his head. "I know, I know. The addict quits when the addict wants to, and not before."

"Have you ever seen one who just couldn't quit|‘So you’ve been hiding here since then?’ Chrissy asked Emma, who nodded in reply. ‘And no one came back? No one came looking for – for a switch?’
Emma seemed taken aback.
‘You know about the switch?’
She stared curiously at both Chrissy and Si. They both nodded: Yes, they knew of the switch|She wondered if his new confidence had to do with her asking him to help with security.
“I’ve listened to Rick’s security recommendations and think we should start by securing the driveway with a gate equipped with a key pad and phone.”  Hank slid the assessment over to Anne.
Rick glanced at Hank, and then turned his attention to Anne|“So, I am to get the smaller, middle bedroom, I assume.”
Kay nodded. “These are the nicest rooms in the keep,” she pointed out, keeping her voice even. “Far better than the barracks below. I am sure they will do for now.”
Galeron frowned at Jack for a moment, then looked back to Kay|I just reached into my pocket and pulled out the list I'd been carrying around for weeks.

"There." Bex pointed at the paper. "William Smith. Gideon Maxwell. Two names, Cam. There are only two names left!"

"I know, but..."

"But what?" Bex demanded.

"But the king is dead, Bex|He wore black jeans, a loose white shirt, and a photographer’s vest, one of those with countless pockets that would in ages past have been stuffed with spare film, and now carried batteries, memory cards, and a satellite phone. He gave Soro an appraising look, with the hint of a rueful smirk playing about his mouth.
“Pleased to meet you,” said Soro|"What's wrong?" Jett's expression reflected his concern and I realized I had been staring at the box for a little too long. "Did I buy the wrong size?"

"No, it's not that. It's just-" My voice faltered. "Why are you doing all of this, Jett|Switching on the lights, I ran to my desk and swore. The tome, my new prized possession, was gone. Grasping the telephone, I dialed Sydney’s number, my anger mounting. After several rings, the telephone was picked up by Sydney’s wife Margery.
Unable to contain my anger, I demanded to speak to Sydney|His black hair is a bit of a mess and he makes it a bit worse by running his fingers through it. The gesture reminds me strongly of Josh. Is that why Sam is here? Is that why I made the offer to run together? Is it because Sam reminds me of Josh that I feel I can trust him? That is not good. I need to make decisions about Sam based on Sam and not based on the fact that he reminds me of Josh|He was making an attempt at humor and I felt encouraged suddenly, and strangely… proud of him. He at least possessed a sarcastic wit. 

“You go ahead,” I told him. “I’ll eat pretty much anything.”

I listened as he told the waiter we would both like to have the Charcoal grilled Miyazaki wagyu. I had no idea what that was so I quickly glanced at my menu|I got back up and made it down, but my right ankle was in pretty bad shape. I could feel the swelling beginning, and I knew I should probably get some ice on it soon.

"Are you okay?" Hailey was at my side as soon as I caught up with her.

"Yeah. I can't believe I'm the one who fell|It was clear that he wasn’t sure that he wanted to acknowledge her presence.
After a moment, he seemed to make a decision. He stood and began to walk toward her table. As he drew closer, Manda saw that his face was very pale and he had pulled a somber pathetic mask over his face.
He stood by their table, looked with blank eyes at Teresa, then swung his head toward Manda|The door opened, and I glanced over at Connor, "The presidential suite, really, for one night?"

"I will have nothing but the best room for my beautiful wife. Isn't my wife beautiful?" Connor asked the bellhop with a wide grin.

"Yes sir, she's very beautiful." I glared at Connor and then smiled at the bellhop|Though my teacher did called it by a different name, I call mine “The Dare Jar”. Please insert dramatic music when reading the name. Generally if we’re feeling bored we’ll go over to the dare jar and fill out some slips of paper and then put them in the jar. The best way to do this is- if you don’t have a writer’s group to help in this effort- have a friend or a few friends and family members write down random quotes or situations and stick them all in the jar|Or they could stop the plane while taking the awfully big risk of escaping on foot. 
“We need to unhook that helicopter somehow,” Declan shrieked. 
“Close the left rear landing gear, Mr. Pasteur!” Kate ordered. 
“We need the wheels for support. If I close them, we’ll crash|Exiting the craft into the hangar, Savannah took a step back when she saw one of their captors in full. Where she might have expected a mouth, she saw a black speaker. A wide luminescent visor covered the portion of the robot's face where its eyes might have been. A single green dot moved back and forth across the visor|I asked, watching the 'men' flounder around on the floor like children.

"It's so good to see the Lilithian family back together again." Morg wiped an imaginary tear from her cheek. "I never thought I'd see the day."

"So, what do you think, Morg|Meghan panicked for a brief second, but it was long enough for her to make the mistake of trying to stop. She braked and swerved, sending her car into a spin. The world whirled around her in a blindingly white display before the side of her car slammed into something hard. Her head hit the window and everything winked out of existence.

Alexander rushed over the snow to check on Meghan|The set of infinities that is itself infinite. How do we go on? When so much happens to us, how do we go on? I took the envelope in my hand. I was already picturing myself opening it. I was already ahead of myself. But I had to stop that image-I had to stop that prediction-because I had no idea what was going to be inside|“You’re the boss.”  There was an edge to his tone.  “I need to get back to work now.”  Placing his cup in the sink, he thanked Daisy, and left the room through the kitchen door.
“That went well,” Anne said sarcastically.
“When it comes to farming, Hank is set in his ways,” said Daisy|"You win, my lord."

"Pardon?"

Bridget laughed. "It's apparent you truly haven't heard those words as often as you claim. Let me say them again, for it might be the last time you hear them from my lips. You win."

"What, pray tell, do I win|You will be allowed to leave after you have received a complete physical examination”, and then he leaves the room. [19]
Evens enters another room where a twelve year old girl is being held under the watchful eye of a military policeman. Evens asks the M.P. for his baton and it is handed over to him. Evens looks at the girl while repeatedly slapping his hand with the baton|She opened one eye and lifted her eyebrow at me.

"Come on," I hissed at Nick. As my mom's voice droned on, I rolled up my yoga mat and whacked Nick in the back of the head with it. He looked up from his obviously painful Reverse Triangle and glared at me. Finally, he took the hint and rolled up his own mat|Jake reached for a cigar, but the one he had earlier was gone. He smiled. 
“You know what I just figured out?” The Mangler stood silent listening to Jake. “I don’t know why, never have, but I still have power over you, because if I die, you die forever.”
The Mangler raised the sickle again, lifted the chain and took a step towards Jake|But I had to go."

He didn't address that. Instead he said, "I came here to tell you I'd come up with a plan for dealing with this situation. A way for each of us to win."

"Win?" she repeated. "What do you mean 'win|He scanned quickly, locking eyes with me then quickly darting away. 
 “He needs to get some heat. As a heel, the crowd should be invested in seeing you lose. They should be booing right now,” Mark whispered as he leaned into me. Yegor didn’t have that connection with the crowd|Undines were supposedly born without souls and marrying a human was one way to get a soul. I felt a moment of fear. I was already half demon. Did this mean I had no soul either?
Aine’s brow furrowed. “I thought you would be happy, but you look troubled.”
“Do I… do I have a soul|The way Cassandra emphasized the word ‘company’ caused Caleb additional discomfort and he could feel the blush rising up his neck and face. Returning the glass to the waiting tray, Caleb retrieved his saddlebags and shook his head. “Thanks anyway ma’am, but I believe I should be on my way.”
“Well at least stay a while until the storm ebbs,” said Cassandra|Chapter 68

The knuckles on Anya’s hands hurt but that didn’t stop her. She rubbed all the harder, making circular motions. The thought of how the bathroom would shine later gave her a pleasant feeling. The sense of cleanliness and order always made her feel calm, almost as if she had taken a pill. She often wondered if something was wrong with her because whenever she was anxious or irritated she had to clean|‘Huff for Perter,’ said the little creature as if to return the sentiment.
Petr removed his satchel and placed it on the ground in front of the bush. ‘Get inside, and be quick.’ 
‘Huff hide,’ acknowledged the little creature as he became invisible.
The leaves parted and Petr could feel the little man-thing climb into the satchel|She bit her lip, then nodded. "He'll hear about it one way or another. Besides, this is his beat now, remember? So go ahead and call it in."

"Who are you talking about?" Bria asked.

"My fiance," she said. "He's a cop just like you, Bria|Bob wondered, as he climbed the staircase, where Mike’s loyalties were, and if he was going to be a problem as the end game approached.
Kiko smiled brightly as Bob approached the executive suite offices. “Hi Bob! Welcome home! But you’re days early, not having much fun in Tokyo? And a new haircut, and suntan! You were busy in Tokyo!”
Bob flashed a confused grin, didn’t anybody know what had happened in Tokyo|Silver balls shot through winding tubes with neon bats running across them, and squeaky coffin lids opened and closed in attempts to catch the ball.

Open Draculas coffinone thousand points, a monsteresque voice commanded as Sebastian hit the ball over a gravestone.

Becky rested her head against Matt. Sebastian couldnt concentrate and lost the silver ball. He relinquished the controls to Matt and stood next to Becky|“Which is exactly what the Eastern Court is going to do, but unfortunately, I can’t do anything about that,” said Cordley. When Cassie looked back at the screen, he was looking down at his hands.
Suddenly, Celeste piped up. “Master, we’re almost to Albany.”
Cassie’s eyes widened “Albany? You drove me all the way to Albany|She’s proven herself.  Isn’t that what you wanted?”
Holiday smiled mirthlessly.  “I guess we both got something we wanted tonight.  I wanted Jill to prove herself.  You wanted her out of the department.”
Riley blinked.  “What are you saying?”
“I’m saying she’s resigned,” said Holiday|Kim looked for a hidden handle or a panel that would reveal a handle, without really expecting to see anything. She ran her hands around the outside edge of the door. Then around the inside edge. She felt nothing unusual.
She laughed. Nothing unusual? My hand is on the side of a spaceship and I can't feel anything unusual|She groaned as she fought to keep her shoulder from popping out of its socket.
“Nice catch,” said Lee.
He closed his eyes and fell backward off the beam.
Haven watched his body fall toward the ground. She turned away at the moment of impact and saw that the little girl was looking up at her calmly. A groan of exertion quickly turned to a scream of pain as Haven lifted the little girl up onto the beam|Anne Marie didn't consider that significant. "It's hardly a prerequisite these days."

Melissa picked up her coffee and Anne Marie noticed that her hands were trembling.

"Do you remember exactly when you and my dad separated?"

Anne Marie expelled her breath. "It's not something I'm likely to forget, Melissa|“Wow, Captain, can I call you Scott?” Affirmed. “They actually pay you for this! By the way, call me Rachael.”
“Okay, Rachael, but only up here. Yeah, this is what every kid dreams about, and I get to do it for money. By the way, let me know if you want to drive|I’m suffering from quite a lot of timelag as it is and I don’t need a headache on top of that.”
“Thank you,” Clint said, clambering into the car. “Now drive us to the Fez.”
“What?”
“I said, ‘Now drive us to the Fez|It was her favorite spot, all warm and sunny, especially on a day like today. As cold as it was outside, the sun was shining bright, making a sun worshiper like Hope groan in delight.

"I thought I'd find you up here," said Sister Olive. She was in her sixties, dressed in faded, plain street clothes rather than a habit|There's no stress of wondering if he'll change his mind and bolt today. It's too late. I've already hooked him."

She grabbed Amelia's and Madeline's hands. "Today is just for fun. So try to have some."

Not likely, Amelia thought as she followed Stacy and Madeline toward the nave. Stacy walked down the aisle first, followed by Madeline|And then an unsettling thought occurred to her. "Uh oh."

"What?"

Eden grimaced, throwing Val a beseeching look. "Are you up for being the buffer between me and Noah's dad?"

"Ahh." Val's eyes lit with comprehension. "Alain has some way to go when it comes to you and Noah|She wasn't an enemy of one of his clients, or someone he had good reason to remove with a few shots from his silenced gun. She was just a woman, someone he'd met at a bar. She wasn't worth it.

He clenched and unclenched his fists.

But he couldn't let it go. She had made him feel things like desire and need and camaraderie and at that moment, anger|I made out a blurry shape standing next to my bed. It was Evan. He leaned over me. I kissed his cheek. Next to me, Pearl played with a wooden doll. Evan tucked us both in. I turned the little star bracelet over in my hand.

The vision faded—a memory from Anabelle's eyes, the moment I gave her the bracelet|He stepped up to the third ball, took his club back slowly and whipped the club head through. The ball soared a hundred feet, paused elegantly, dropped eighty feet on to the thatched roof of the starter's hut and bounced down.

Bond handed back the club. Hawker's eyes were thoughtful, amused. He said nothing. He pulled out the driver and handed it to Bond|There are four ports down here,” I pointed to one of the caps covering the small hole where a tube would normally be installed during a spraying operation.
“In addition to weddings, you’re also an expert on rain barrels,” the lieutenant commented, not bothering to hide her disbelief.
“Not really,” I admitted with a slight shrug. “My dad could or his colleague, Lara Street, could better answer your questions about the barrels|When she's close enough, she extends her hand. "Hello, my name is Natalie. I'm Beatrice's mother."

Beatrice. That name is so wrong for her.

I clasp Natalie's hand and shake it. I've never been fond of Dauntless hand-shaking. It's too unpredictable-you never know how tightly to squeeze, how many times to shake|Before I can ask how a hologram can touch me, something rises out of my heart area and appears in front of me: a hologram of a sheet of paper with English writing on it. It hangs in the air at my eye level. 
“Wow!” I breathe. I am impressed. Like magic! I know it’s science, but, wow|And then she swung her broom! 
After that everything seemed to go in slow motion, like one of those old fashioned movies. Slowly I saw the broom swinging nearer and nearer. I was unable to move. Then I felt a shove. Poindexter was pushing me! Quick as lightning, I darted off—not toward Marlin and the others, but away from the broom|He gritted his teeth and tried to reinforce his mental shields, but they were weak, too shaky to battle any real power. "You shouldn't be here, Kizira."

"Then you shouldn't have called me."

Huh? He tried to lift up, but an invisible hammer pounded his head with vicious enthusiasm.

"I didn't call you, Kizira|But I'm not sure if I should be supporting you or putting up a big fat stop sign in your path." She brought her hands to her forehead, massaging her temples. "What to do, what to do? Maybe we should call Brian."

I flew up from the table. "You should be supporting me. Please! And we don't need to call Brian|But she was nice, nice to him; he couldn’t be mean to her. But he, well, it just didn’t seem right. His Mum could be here somewhere, his Dad should think about that. What if they did find her and Dad was laughing with Kaitlin? That would hurt his Mum’s feelings. They had the Stormclouds now, they would understand if he and his Dad went to find his Mum|She is decimating your churches. That is the effect, and effect usually—and legally—leads back to intent as the cause. There is no way this young lady does not know that her gun is loaded.”
Heads nod around the table. Jones has a point.
“And it’s aimed right at you,” said Jones|Which means I want “that” a lot, and “that” isn’t referring to the plate of food in front of me. “That” is Miles. Us. Me kissing Miles. Miles kissing me.

I’m suddenly very thirsty. I grab my glass and down half of my water in three huge gulps.

“Do you have a girlfriend, Miles|"I'm from Maine." He kissed the back of her hand. "But the company I work for is in North Carolina, so I guess I'll be spending most of my free time there. How about you?"

"I'm the opposite. I grew up near Charlotte but I live in Maine|"Wait," Cassie said, moving from the kitchen to the living room. "There's time for that." She retrieved two large bath towels from the linen closet and tossed one at Nick. "Dry yourself off," she said.

He laughed. "I guess we are a little wet|I even asked the reverend mother Abbess here, if there was some task that you could perform, of benefit to the convent. She said you could become our gardener.” 
“Is that what you wish milady?” 
“Of course not. Oh why didn’t I meet you a year ago? This could all be different. No Culann, you are terribly sweet to say so, but we both know you would go crazy if you had to live the life of a gardener|You’re sweet, sexy and you have a good heart.” 
Before she could answer, Paul leaned toward her, his mouth dipping down to hers. Selena didn’t realize what was happening until his lips touched hers. She leaped back, jumping off the bed and backing away. “I think you should go now, Paul|I tell her I’ve never been there but I’d like to go one day.

She smiles again.

I think she says it’s a nice town, but it’s hard to understand her

words when all I hear in my head is her name.

Rachel.

I’m gonna fall in love with you, Rachel|In the chaos ahead, they'd be waving those tablets around-her tablets-as still more evidence of their own wisdom and holiness.

"I'm sorry that your tablets are gone, Siferra," Beenay said. "But maybe there's still a chance the Apostles didn't steal them. That they'll turn up somewhere."

"I'm not counting on that," said Siferra|"I didn't mean-"

She pulled free, though it cost her, because she loved the feel of his hands on her. But best to get used to doing without, wasn't it? "Doesn't matter. Really. Let's just finish up this proposal."

"Right." He watched her carefully, then said, "The proposal|But then in the end she didn't have to.

"This is the daddy I want," Jessie said in a voice as clear as crystal. If Meg had wanted to be discreet about the drawing those hopes were dashed immediately. Jessie pointed to the stick figure of the man. "Mommy, when are you going to get me a daddy|I've tried my father, Inari, and Linus, but none of them are picking up."

Morgan frowned. "You think Reapers are at the auditorium?"

"Yes," I said. "They have to be there because that's where Logan is, and they need him for the ritual. Come on. We have to get over to the auditorium|Each had six legs, two antennae, and a pair of razor-sharp mandibles that opened and closed horizontally, shearing the starshade to bits. They were aligned in a clear formation, shoulder to shoulder, like a well-trained army. Hundreds of soldier ants. Headed right for them.

"Warrior!" Ripred shouted. "Look at me!" Gregor tore his eyes off the ants and turned to Ripred|"Montrose would never-"

"Leave him to me."

Julienne narrowed her eyes. "Even if that were true, I've already agreed to accompany Lord Fontaine to a literary luncheon tomorrow."

Lucien's lips tightened grimly. "The day after, then."

She nodded. "If you can arrange to garner my brother's approval, I would love to go on a picnic with you, Lucien|They have not been able to integrate the discoveries of science into the fabric of our societies in a way that satisfies us as human beings.  The question of whether poetry has failed us, or we have failed poetry is still open to interpretation.*
Nobody knows for sure.
* When asked in an interview to tell us something surprising about himself, evolution writer Richard Dawkins said, “I’d love to be a poet|While straddling the limb, he took off the rope, attached it to the tree, and then let himself slide to the ground.
Cayden trotted toward the guardhouse and stopped just shy of it.  “See?  Up and over in a minute!  I’ll have you inside in a sec.”
A sound came to them from inside the guardhouse|I have to get going."

"Hot date?"

"Hardly." Helen looks over at Nicole. "Remember ... prison, surgeon ... conversation..." She points to Brian and then back at her before leaving the room and going out the front door.

Silence reigns for about ten seconds before Brian turns to face Nicole|At least he thought it was thunder. Glancing over at Addie, he checked her reaction, but her eyes remained fixed on the screen.

Assuming the noise had come from the movie, he turned his attention back to the screen just as another rumble reached his ears. Next to him Addie tensed, and he knew the sound hadn't come from the movie|One of the models who had run away from an abusive boyfriend told me about this place. It's a boardinghouse run by an angel of a woman named Grace Seidel.

I took my mother there to stay until I could find an apartment for her. I used to visit her at Grace's every day. My mother loved it and became friends with some of the boarders|he asked, standing up and walking over to stand beside my legs. He barely had to look up to meet my gaze.

"I wanted to check on you. Beau said you had a concussion."

Sawyer chuckled and skipped a rock he'd been holding in his hand across the water. "He tell you how I got the concussion|If she doesn’t understand, it doesn’t matter, it seems.
So you have changed the book, then?
Stacey returns to the script. “What book isn’t changed? I handed over the manuscript and was given some notes, which I chose to make myself. The version in the paper, and the book, is more personal and accurate about my life and experiences|I thought of lying, but decided this group would see right through it. "Because my handlers in StarTech thought I should see what normal kids my age are like."
Jas snorted and a few other kids at the table laughed. It was better than I could have expected and I picked up a fork and tried the meal. 
"I can't believe someone with all your loot's eating that slop," said Jas|Let me know if you need anything.”
Rowan sipped his tea. It was very good, high quality. He appreciated the warmth running down his throat.
“Such a nice place, don’t you think?” Petrov said.
“Yes, quite,” Rowan said. “Are you a frequenter, Mr. Petrov|Jessica stared at the proffered hand, then took it. Finally, she wrenched her gaze away from their shaking hands to the woman's face. "I'm Jessica, Roy's niece," she said around a throat so dry it felt like the Sahara.
"Well, now, I'm very pleased to meet you, Jessica|Gladys and Macklin had retired to the living room, while Fluffy examined the contents of the fridge.
Macklin was showing Gladys his collection of track-planning handbooks, and his photographs of famous model railroaders.
Gladys was keenly interested; here was the real Macklin, the key to the inner duck.
"These guys are all celebrities," said Macklin|But what would all that have to do with the missing item, as Gaudreaux had called it, the rare jewel he had alluded to?
Just then, the waiter returned with my order.  I would have to read the article more thoroughly later.  There wasn't time now.  Just enough to finish up my café-au-lait and then off to meet with Gaudreaux|“I don’t know,” she said, “It’s not a see-through cup.”
“I know,” Marie said and smiled. “But how much do you think it weighs?”
“I have no idea,” Amber shrugged her shoulders.
“That’s okay, because it really doesn’t matter how much it weighs|She knew that Marten had just said all she intended to say at the moment, still, a part of her was expecting more, and so—from what she could tell—did both jury and prosecution. Therefore she spoke, to clarify things:
“That is all?”
“Yes, your honor, that is all,” answered Marten|As their breathing slowed and reality came back into focus, both of them realized that they were still in the foyer against the wall and both completely dressed except for Lana's thong underwear which had been discarded somewhere. He lifted his head and looked down at her, still holding her against the wall. Shaking his head, he said, "I'm sorry Lana|Garrick poured a splash of whisky in a glass gave it to Percy, who didn’t quite know what to do with it. He’d longed for the day when the boys saw him as a man, but he wasn’t expecting it today. Garrick didn’t dwell on Percy however.
‘The Federation wasn’t expecting it,’ said Garrick|“I could use a doorman and twenty four hour security in my life,” said Katrina.
“So when do you want to take a look?” asked Allison.
“I don’t know when I’ll be able to.  You can go ahead and check it out.  If you like it, I’m fine with it,” said Katrina|They could feel the sweat trickling down the side of their heads. When their boss spoke in this calm tone, it meant he was raging inside.
"I swear, we didn't see anything," said Gerald.
"We were dragging her into the van and then we were knocked out," Anthony explained. 
"Sam didn't see anything either and he was looking directly at us from the van," continued Gerald|Though his face was only in profile, I could see that his expression matched the absolute certainty in his tone when he spoke.

"Archons."

I let out a short laugh. "Is it me, or do they seem outnumbered? I've seen several demons, but only one of them."

"You're right, they're outnumbered|She didn't even get the puzzle right! I know you had shrimp for lunch!"

Ripred rolled his eyes at Lizzie. "You see? This is the sort of thing I've been dealing with for the past year. Enlighten him, won't you?"

"It was just a puzzle, Gregor, not what really happened," said Lizzie|It didn’t take long to find a parchment with the Fortigroff crest on it, and then he hurried to class, so his absence wouldn’t rouse any suspicion. Dagdron never particularly enjoyed class time, and he couldn’t get his mind off his father and wondering what was really going on with the Arch of Avooblis.
Elloriana, Earl, and Lita were already waiting at the tree after classes, anxious to know if Dagdron had found the parchment|Hunter covered his eyes with his hands and was barely able to hold back the tears. “I came because I wanted to finish what she was doing. If I am not mistaken, she offered you the position of director. Isn’t that right, Dr. Hampton?”
Lan looked first at Katherine and then at Hunter|He appeared remarkably offended. "I am a king, not a chief. You will discover that the Weres are far more sophisticated than vampires, despite our reputation as savages."

Caught off guard by his obvious annoyance, Darcy gave a lift of her brows. "I would never mistake you for a savage|'Being reasonable was more acceptable to my long-held cynical view of life, love and marriage, but there was no reason whatsoever in the powerful feelings you stirred in me, Tess, and you must know reason flew completely out the door once you told me about Zack.'

She looked at him wonderingly, not quite convinced by what he was telling her.

'Surely you understand everything changed that night when I was confronted by you-already the mother of my child-and our son. It gave me the most intimate connections I could have, and I'm not like my father, Tess|"Lissa's uptown, doing the full ballet press. I think you should get in touch."

"Did I really know her that well?"

He nodded. "Yeah, she was with you a lot, you know, after you and Rachel had a falling-out."

"Wait-now you're saying I had a falling-out with Rachel|“As we walked toward it a figure appeared to me just ahead of us. It was a Kilto elder, of that I am sure. But not in the form I would expect; it was more like an apparition. It was waving us away and then it simply disappeared.”
“I did not see anything, how do you know it was a Kilto elder|But the fact that she was in the First Circle of Jaenelle's courtdid matter.

Reluctantly, he opened the door and stepped back to let her enter.

"I have an appointment in a few minutes," he said coldly.

"I came to apologize," Karla said. "It won't take long. I'm not very good at them, so I tend to keep them short|“Of course,” added Young, “they would have no idea about the copies that Claudia and Sally have. Although if they realised their involvement, they might assume they have copies and start looking for them.”
“You mean burgle our houses?” said Claudia, horrified at the thought.
“I think you have to consider that possibility, yes,” replied Young|Before their eyes, the bird transformed into a short, plump man with arms extending down nearly to his ankles! The man grabbed clothes that had apparently been hidden behind the tent, hurriedly dressed, and waddled out from between the tents, blending into the mingling crowd.
Andy and Alden stared at each other.
“Did you see that?!” Alden gasped. 
“His wings transformed into arms,” replied Andy|“I guess it means,” Carlos fixed the other tag back into place, “that she’s been chipped. The vets have a machine and they use it to scan the chip and find out where lost animals live.”
“A machine?” his manager said. “I’m not sure I like the sound of that, Carlos|They follow them for a quarter of a mile, at which point, the vampires had begun to assemble themselves into a line, almost like an invisible funnel forced them.
They followed the line, and it led them to a curved road where half a dozen semi trucks were parked. The vampires crawled into their beds and stood face to face in them.
As the first one got full, the line moved to the second and third truck|I smacked at the demon’s face and lunged once more, this time catching a twisted horn. I pulled, wrenching the bull’s neck as we skittered across the sky. With one hand already looking to remove the wood spike, the Galla released its other hand. When the second hand released me, I let go of the horn|Finally noticing that they were looking across the room, Claire turned to look as well. "Hey, Ava and Brant are here. I better hurry up and deliver this coffee. I think they have a meeting with Jason soon."

Claire now had Beth and Ella's complete attention. "Who are they?" Beth asked.

"Oh, that's Declan's sister, Ava, and his brother, Brant|I take a deep breath and flip a pencil around on my desk.

"I'm not going to," I confess.

"What?" Rae asks, her voice raised.

"If you feel like you have to tell my mother what's going on, then go for it.

I can't ask Nyelle what happened to her, Rae|Throughout the ages of the universe, death is just a stall in life. The possibility of the elements forming in the exact positions used to make us living is complete, it is not empty. The manifestations of humanity are endless, and this simulation is proof of it. Throughout the infinite series of universe, it is incorrect to say that we die|In response to James’ question, Elise simply shook her head and distracted from the question she was sick of answering. “How do you know what you know?” she turned back to James. “How can you see them?”
James pressed his lips into a thin line. “It’s a gift.” he said sarcastically. 
“Doesn’t sound much like a gift|A blue flame rose in the midst of the stones. Dako pulled the carriage into the center of it and up a steep stone ramp. The creature burst to the surface, snorting and blowing water from its nostrils. Fane opened the carriage door. Tear drops of water dripped from its sides. He kicked the steps down and in two strides stood on the ramp|And that includes you, Millie.” I take a breath and start for the door.
“Lexie wait!” she calls, but I don’t stop, slamming the door on my way out.
***
Eight o’clock and I’m home helping Mother set the table for dinner. Tonight, we have dinner with the new neighbors|But she could also guess the truth of it: that just as vampires and ghosts became tethered to a place, so werewolves became tethered to a pack. Biffy's all too frequent melancholy must hurt Conall terribly.

"How will allowing him to accompany you help?"

"Am I not also part of this pack|I have seen it, Kandrigi. It is a great body, capable of great destruction,
Let your race he warned, Kandrigi, for I grieve for them and their destiny.
Through time it comes from afar, Kandrigi; in time it will cross the path of your earth.
Believe me, Kandrigi, believe me, I grieve for you and your race|Grant used to watch kids in museums as they stared open-mouthed at the big skeletons rising above them. He wondered what their fascination really represented. He finally decided that children liked dinosaurs because these giant creatures personified the uncontrollable force of looming authority. They were symbolic parents. Fascinating and frightening, like parents. And kids loved them, as they loved their parents.

Grant also suspected that was why even young children learned the names of dinosaurs|"Please, my friends call me Cameron, and trust me you'd rather be my friend than my enemy," Cameron said with a chuckle.
"Certainly, Cameron," Elijah said clearing his throat and loosening his collar, "What can I do for you?"
"Remember when you gave a lecture on "The Difference between the Canadian and American Legal System at Queen's University last year," said Cameron|“I can’t believe it,” Beth squealed when she told her about the part in Don’s movie. They were riding their horses alongside the river, picking their way slowly among the shade of the cottonwoods. “You’re so lucky, Selena. You’ve been discovered,” she said, a note of awe in her voice. 
“But I don’t want to be discovered|But where love was concerned, he could be very creative (even if he wasn't very courageous)
"I won't have to fight anybody," said Elias with a sly smile, "as long as you come with me."
"Me?" said Mitch in surprise.  "What would you want to drag me along for if you're going to see a girl?"
"Aw, c'mon, Mitch," said Elias|Eventually we arrive at a cluster of large rocks blocking the path and Aiden climbs up and then drops down. I follow, landing a little loudly. There's rocks surrounding the area and Aiden rolls the largest rock out of the way, revealing a cave nestled behind it. I carry Maci inside. There isn't much room and when we enter it, it makes the fit even tighter, yet we somehow manage and Aiden seals us in with the rock|That’s all it says!”
“The ladder? You didn’t say that before! Chrissakes Ish. You are getting too human. That sort of details is crucial! Are you sure it says ‘ladder?’”
“Yes. Sorry. I was paraphrasing to save time.”
Jonr stared at Ishmael for a moment before sitting down again and exhaling:
“Okay, so it’s something about the ladder|I had earplugs in, or I would have heard your elemental alarm and woken up sooner," Bria said, moving around the room and staring at the dead men. "Who are these guys?"

"Some of Randall Dekes's men. Remember Pete and Trent from the restaurant?"

Bria looked at the bodies, and her face tightened with recognition. "They didn't stay in jail very long, did they? They must have come looking for us as soon as they made bail|Even though I knew two points didn't make a pattern, I was still disappointed to find nothing there. It couldn't just end. Not now.

3A

You are leaving me messages, but I haven't gotten the message yet.

3B

I took out my notebook. I ripped out a page. I wrote WHO ARE YOU? across the top and left the rest of it blank|“I don’t know why I said what I said.”
“Because it was how you really felt.  If we would’ve gotten married, we might’ve been able to pull if off for a while—maybe a few years if we were lucky but then the bandages would’ve fallen from our eyes.  You’d be you and I’d be me, and we’d be on our way to a divorce|The doctor, who was extremely straightforward, told me that nothing further would happen with the body, but advised me very little was left of the body. EBE-2 then told me the leader was concerned that we were upset. That we were their guests. That the leader was upset that we were offended. The leader did not wish to upset us and promised that nothing further would happen to the body|"You needn't worry. I'm perfectly safe wherever I go."

"Yeah? Why is that?"

"I have a bodyguard."

"You do? Why?"

"My parents are very protective."

"No sh...no kidding. I don't think I've ever dated a girl who had her own bodyguard|Headed down the hallway.

He wasn't particularly surprised to hear footsteps following him. Connor's hand flew out and grabbed his arm right before Eric went into his office.

"Do you think I don't know?" Connor said, his voice low and rasping.

Tread carefully. Eric let his brows climb as he looked at Connor|'It'll be every bit of your treasure this time, and no market-tricks,' said Giles, 'or dead you'll be, and I shall hang your skin from our church steeple as a warning.'

'It's cruel hard!' said the dragon.

'A bargain's a bargain,' said Giles|Trina said, "I can't lead you through it."
"Activation is the first step." Trina said, "Maybe you were in danger or maybe you were subjected to magic for the first time. Either way, your magic was awakened to protect you."
Maji frowned. "I thought you said it wasn't real magic|Her smile widened at Acheron. "And how are you, Aqueron?"

"Bien. Is Kyrian up in his office?"

"He is."

Ash headed for the ornate curving staircase.

"So, Nick, quieres tu comer?"

He hesitated. "Wait, you threw in a new word|Ana was playing on the fire pole in the corner, trying to climb up it.
	“Where does this thing go?” she asked.
	“Walt Disney used to have an apartment right above this fire station,” Dizzy explained. “He would stay here overnight and wanted to watch people as they entered the park. This fire pole was his way down from the apartment|"Get back to the Athena right now!"

"Screw you." Renna shook her head, frantically trying to switch off the line. "Don't come after me, Finn. I don't want to hurt you, but I won't let you take me in."

"I don't have a choice, Renna|Ray had sat through several of those miserable affairs while clerking for the Judge.

Chancery Court had jurisdiction for two reasons. First, Gibson was dead and his estate was a Chancery matter. Second, he had a child under the age of eighteen. The legal business of minors belonged in Chancery Court.

Gibson also had three children who were not minors|"Oh, our baby brother, Kamal, appreciates the hell out of us." Farooq chuckled, eliciting an exasperated growl from Kamal. "You on the other hand, Najeeb, are to be pitied..."

Having had enough and still holding Jala's hand, Mohab rose. "And here I want to thank you all for celebrating this momentous occasion with me and Jala|"Yeah, I was trying to use it a couple of minutes ago when I found these in the battery compartment," said Katrina as she poured the Chocolate Diamonds on the kitchen table.
"Well I'll be damned.  You found these in your computer?" asked the captain.
"In the battery to be more exact.  But I noticed my computer feels lighter, so I'm wondering if there might be more inside," said Katrina|Gabriel saw that the end of his line was already past the second ice cave opening; and with a strong shove, he let himself slide just above it and literally jumped into the face of the other cave opening without knowing if it really was one or not. He fell into the cave and rolled against a far wall. Just as he did, he noticed an opening that looked like a lava tunnel going up. He took a chance just as he heard Araklba sliding down in front of the opening|Annie and Dougal getting married, after twenty years and all that had happened in between, was most definitely a romantic fairytale come alive.

Even though she was happy for her friend, very happy, staggeringly happy, Isabella's fingers tensed and the nails embedded deeper into the flesh of her palms.

Mikey looked back out the window and so did Isabella|I turned and tested the thick snaggle of vine that rose over the plastered brick. I leapt up and planted my right foot as high as I could in the thick mesh and rose in one leap to throw my arms over the top of the wall.

Flavius had risen from the grass and rushed to me.

"Madam, I beg you not to do this," said Flavius|Behind her, Frances stumbled, and tried to catch her balance as the ship pitched again.

'Here it is,' said Margaret. 'Hello?' she called, and knocked tentatively, unsure if she would be heard above the din. 'Is Dennis there?'

There was the briefest silence, then an outburst of catcalling and whistling. A cry of 'Chaffer up, lads, we've got visitors|I don't know why his bare chest wasn't as eyecatching as his chest peeking through all that sheer cloth, but I couldn't eat and sit across from him while he wore the apron. The second time I missed my mouth with the stew, Doyle asked him to take the apron off.

"That doesn't work for most of the rest of the smaller fey|She pouts.

"You know you're really f**king cute when you're upset?"

"You're so..." she stops, like she's trying to think of a word to use to describe me.

"Annoying," Liz supplies, laughing.

"Yes," Lilly says, looking at Liz|“You can’t understand or even guess what is going on with Nicholas right now, and I only wish I could tell you.”
Barthow stood up shaking his head. He offered me the bucket of pig milk and I dry heaved when the warm fluid splashed a few drops onto my arm. 
“Yuck, drink it yourself.” I backed up as he followed me with the bucket|He got out, dapper and urbane in his Thomas Durand persona, popped the trunk, and took out an oblong object bundled in canvas and wrapped with a cord. He swung it onto his shoulder, which proved to be a difficult feat - the thing was about four and a half feet long and two feet wide.

We headed to the door. Saiman caught up with us and passed the bundle to Jim. Jim showed no strain as he took the bundle|"Protecting artifacts is all well and good, but you don't need cars full of guards for that. So what's really going on?"

Linus grimaced, as if he was upset that they'd already realized he wasn't telling them everything, but he nodded. "It seems that the Reapers are particularly interested in one or more of the artifacts|His gaze was fixed ahead of him as he carried her upwards. She turned her head and saw, to her amazement, behind his back were glorious silver feathered wings soaring in flight. She checked to see if Kerim’s body had become transparent. Thankfully, she could still see his T-shirt and leather jacket. He was in human form, except for the wings|It’s pretty much all they learned about while growing up, besides don’t mess up or you’ll become a part of the Dark Clan, and you don’t want that. 
Becca works her down to the ‘CLANS’ shelf, where she knows she can find something about the clans and the leader. 
She pulls a large book with a smiling white mask on the front and the title The In’s and Out’s of the Light Clan, and flips through its pages, looking for a picture of a man dressed in both dark and light colors, or the word ‘leader|"Come Jo, let's get settled in the living room, shall we," Marguerite urged, turning her into the room with a hand on her arm. Glancing up the hall, she added, "And you boys bring the goodies... as well as Nicholas. There's no sense hiding him now."

Jo moved reluctantly into the living room, only to pause by the nearest chair and glance back toward the door for Nicholas|They could see the whole of the chain in one glimpse-wooded hills rising toward the biggest mountain of the bunch, a four-thousand-foot unnamed peak, most of it above timberline and blanketed in scarlet and yellow from the turning underbrush. A valley cut through the middle of the range, and it was here that they spotted two lakes, one in the middle, one on the eastern edge.

"You could land on either of those lakes|They helped Joy stand, and they got her up to the room and onto the bed.  “I’ll get some ice for an ice pack, that will make her feel better,” Beth told Lynn as she grabbed the ice bucket and headed out of the room and down the hall.
Since the casinos were small, each one only had a few rooms|They'd recently had several meetings in conjunction with the senator's campaign and fund-raising efforts.

"How are you, Senator?"

"Good, and you?"

"Busy as always. What can I do for you?"

"I was wondering how well you know your neighbor."

"My neighbor?" Mike had assumed Holbrook wanted to talk about the campaign|Regardless, Mal found her quite captivating.  She called herself "Miss 'Not To"'.  When Mal had asked her, "Why?", she had said because she wasn't "not to anything".  It was a family joke she had said.  She was not too tall, not to short, not to heavy, not to thin, not to beautiful, not ugly, not to anything|"I'm too goddam scared of Palmer to set foot outside this building; of course I'm not going to Mars and what you say is absolutely true."

"But no one," Roni said softly, "is going to fire you. The way you did Barney."

"I'm firing myself. Inside. It hurts."

"But not enough to make you go to Mars|A bigger version of that castle on the playground.

"I was finishing up the last-minute touches when your plane landed and lost track of time," Caleb says.

I can't believe I didn't notice it before. I don't know what to say... "It's a castle. I can't believe you made me a castle|Trella squelches her remorse; the child simply had to be forced to come along as it was unconscionable to even consider allowing her to remain in a cabin alone.
Trella watches as the plump woman keeps a firm hold on Pearlitta’s shoulder and steers her toward a large, boxy wagon inline with the convoy. The girl slings her long brown hair over her shoulder and, casting Trella a last scathing glare, stomps ahead of the woman to enter the wagon|Nothing is as crucial to my father as his word.” He pulls me in a hug as I battle to control my erratic chest. “I won’t let anything happen to you. I promise.”
“You knew about this, yet you agreed to a partnership with me?” I ask as I pull away from the embrace|I'd just walked to the sink to rinse my mug, still in a daze (and exhausted) from last night's sexathon with Marco, when Nish hurried over to my side.

She ignored my questioning gaze to look over her shoulder. As soon as the last teacher walked out of the staff room she turned back to me, her dark eyes sparkling with excitement. "I heard things are going well with you and Marco|Just remember — always listen to your heart. I love you, baby.”
“I love you too, Mom.”
The line goes dead, and I have an uneasy feeling in my stomach. I decided to go downstairs and talk to my dad. Maybe he knows what’s going on with Mom|He'd just been so concerned about not running into his fiancee, he hadn't made the connection that the woman he was running to was his fiancee.

Erik couldn't believe his luck. Suddenly, his mood lightened and he had the most incredible feeling of excitement for his upcoming wedding. Ten minutes ago, he was trying to figure out how to delay the wedding. Now he was wishing time would fly so he could be done with the formalities and move on to the honeymoon|‘They think that only my grandfather knows the location of the secret entrance…’ 
 
She broke off as two savage figures appeared down the street. Abruptly Walwain thrust Claudia into the cover of the archway, turned, and drew his sword.
 
The two Saxons were large, well-built and tall, with long fair hair. One wore an iron helmet; both carried spears and shields. The nearer one halted at the sight of Walwain|"Maybe I won't meet him today at all. I'm just being sent back to 1956 to do my homework in a cellar."

"Yes, but maybe you'll run into him before or after that."

"Lesley, I'm not his type."

"He didn't mean it that way," said Lesley|“I’m telling them what went down in the graveyard,” the storyteller explains.
“In the graveyard?”  Geist asks, turning to Cale with a puzzled expression.
“You haven’t heard?”  Cale blurts out, shocked there is anyone who isn’t aware of the fall of Captain Keeta.  “Aqua lives in the housing closest to the graveyard|He shook his head remembering the horror on his Dad's face whenever he was called Nigel. Tiny and his Dad gave him a nickname, which, fortunately, stuck. "Mom named Nash, Edward. He hates the name and doesn't let anyone know it."

"I can't believe your name is Nigel|They proceeded to the kitchen and sat at the table. Marla picked a pen up, prepared to take notes.
“What kinds of things do you like to eat, Ms. Harris and Mrs. Wembly?”
“Let’s approach it this way, Ms. Curtis. What kinds of foods do you enjoy cooking ?”
“Excuse me, but could you call me Marla|“Well, we would be very limited of the questions we could ask. It would depend where they would take us,” Clark said.
Wagner added, “But I would welcome any opportunity to question him. Let the Judge see what kind of person he is. That could help us down the line.”
“Let’s not go there,” said Clark|"A Ouija board," I answered. I glanced at Calvin, and he nodded his head approvingly.

"What does it do?"

"It uses mediums-spirits-to answer your questions," Calvin said. "Don't you have to hold hands when using the Ouija board?"

I asked, hoping the rumors I'd heard about the Ouija board were true, and that I'd look knowledgeable in front of Calvin|He would neutralize the threat at once, return to the entrance to secure it, and proceed from there.
With one hand gripping the shovel and the other gripping the shopping cart, Sven pushed the cart slowly toward the glow, glancing back every few paces at the Wegmans entrance. 
When he was close to the far end of the parking lot, within twenty feet of the glow that he now made out to be moving and flitting about—just like a firefly might—Sven let go of the cart|“Now, not every Naforian can understand animals just as some Naforians can only make elemental stones glow and nothing more. It all depends how much of the essence is contained within you. This is why you must be Renegade born and tested at birth to see if you contain the amount of essence required for Renegade training. Not everyone is cut out to be a Renegade|The desert was right below; a dreaded, familiar sight. Endless desert.
The ground suddenly rushed up to meet him, and his chair slammed down hard onto the fine sand, jarring him violently and bringing up a cloud which followed his parachute as it sped away. He then was dragged by the wind across the surface of the desert, and he tried using his legs to anchor himself, but it was no use against the weight of the chair|She couldn’t guarantee anything in the way of compensation for him, but when he heard the first poem, he was hooked.
Jillian met with Irving and Jay two times before Christmas, and by year-end she had a finished product.
With the rebirth of her muses and having completed the musical in less than six months, churning out the second play was a piece of cake. By the end of her third year in the city, Jillian earned her Master’s degree and completed not one but two plays in addition to the musical|I’m leaving for the day; stay out of trouble.” Gabe stormed off away from the building. 
Nadia was left not knowing what had just happened. This behavior wasn’t normal for Gabe. He never left work in the middle of the day, and he never spoke to her like that. Now she had two goals for the day, find out what a hit man’s hobbies are and find out what happened with Gabe|Trip looks up, his mouth still open, paused on a word. "I was just trying to help. I know how much you hate menus."

I want to punch him in the f**king face.

"I'll be fine," Emily says. She leans over my shoulder and looks down at my menu|She nodded. “Ask anything you want.”
“Did I hear you call this place the Cat House? I thought everyone knew it as the Canary House.”
“It is. Cat House is what those who’ve been here a long time call it.” She lowered her voice to an almost conspiratorial whisper, even though no one had come into the hall to overhear|That brought them back to the original reason Trent had called him. Regret climbed into the bed between them. Trent was convinced Lauren was a shyster. What if he was right?

"Money?" Gage spat out the word.

She flinched and met his gaze. "I've told you before I don't want the Hightowers'money|But, I reason it is better to keep moving rather than trying to move later tonight with a bunch of sleepy children. The shadow has disappeared for about a minute now. I decide to wave Katie across as I give her the “shhh” sign; which means to be extra quiet. I stare down the street to where the shadow crossed, and then back at Katie|There were photos of gala evenings with beautiful people in beautiful clothes, photos of keys to small houses being given to families, streets being renovated and more along that line. Most photos had descriptions of the events being shown, complete with the names of everyone in the pictures. My attention was caught by one of the photos|Phillip must have sensed my thoughts, because he made himself loosen his fists and step back, although his jaw was still clenched so tightly it made his chiseled cheekbones stand out like arrows pushing against his skin.

Phillip and I weren't friends, not exactly, but he was trying to look out for me in his own way. So I decided to put his mind at ease - so to speak.

"You're forgetting one thing, Phillip|At fifteen years of age, the boy had developed a slender but wiry figure and a head of thick, cherry-red hair. Even as a teenager, the boy had not lost his brazen cheerfulness. Sigurd was also glad Edric had not dropped his childhood habit of calling Sigurd ‘Uncle’ even though they weren’t related. Without any hesitation, he fell upon Sigurd with a breath-wrenching hug|“Let sleeping dogs lie. That’s what he said. Let sleeping dogs lie.”
Ananda was a little shocked at that, at the insensitivity of the man. But perhaps he should not be surprised, he thought. It seemed like par for the Charles course.
“That was a bit insensitive,” said Ananda|"Who are you?" she asked. "What are you?"

Last time, he'd ignored her. This time, he answered. My name is X, and I am your ... helper.

X. "As in, X marks the spot?"

Exactly.

"Just how are you supposed to help me, X|'You get into that one, Nicol.' His marine captain appeared behind him, pointing to the one alongside. 'Make sure they've all got their jackets on.'

'Sir, I'd rather wait on deck, if that's-'

'I want you in the boat.'

'Sir, if it's all the same I'll-'

'Nicol, in the boat|“Belle is sick?  How sick is she?”  Mal said trying to keep terror out of his voice.
“Mal, calm down, she isn’t really sick.  Here, breathe into this bag a few times.  That will calm you down.’
“Amelia, I don’t need the bag|But how was that even possible? Besides me, Logan had been the only other person there, and I knew the Spartan wouldn't try to scare me like that.

"Are you okay, Gypsy girl?" Logan asked. "You look sort of distracted."

I pushed all thoughts of the creepy whispers away and focused on Logan|"If you two are done doing what you're doing, we have things to discuss."

Calvin squeezed my shoulder as I turned to face forward. "What is it that you want to discuss?"

Liam turned away when I looked at him. "We're lost. Maybe we should discuss that."

"What makes you think we are lost|"Beautiful country there. Where are you from?" he asked as he studied my face, likely to ascertain the answers I'd sought a minute earlier.

"Pennsylvania. We don't have that many lakes."

The man extended his hand and introduced himself as Derek. I smiled and said, "It's nice to meet you, Derek|She could have done it herself; it was made for one person to handle, and she had practiced until she knew she could do it with a minimum of fuss, but with two people the job took only moments. Brushing away the rocks so they would have a smooth surface beneath the tent floor took longer, but even so, they weren't going to have a comfortable bed for the night.

When they were finished, she eyed the tent with misgivings. It was long enough for Chance, but...She visually measured the width of his shoulders, then the width of the tent|We all know exactly what is going on with everyone else all the time,” Rome answered.
Rei exhaled then took a deep breath. “So I’ll ask you again,” he said. “What do you do for fun?”
“And I will answer you the same way,” Rome replied. “As I understand your definition of it, we do not have fun|I have not had a place to hide from the witch’s scorn for a very long time. I would rather chance being broken or cracked than spend the next thousand years at the mercy of the witch.”
“Very well then, Pan, but you come at your own peril. We must hurry.” 
“Thank you, thank you,” said Pan|The late Lord Peterus himself had done it, when he'd captured the Copper Strangler.

Letting a rival constable interview the prisoners would be risky. Potentially losing the prisoners completely-as Brettin chanced doing-was even more so.

"How long?" Brettin said.

"Fifteen minutes each," Wayne said.

Brettin's eyes narrowed just slightly. "Ten minutes with two of the prisoners|Whose car do you want to take? Mine? Then we can put the top down."

"That's fine," Gavin agreed. "But let me drive. Please, by all that's holy, let me drive."

Everyone laughed and I scowled.

"Why does everyone keep teasing me about my driving|"Right."

"So," Jenna said softly, "are you going to take care of Jake's little problem or do you need a rescue?"

He didn't look happy, but he also didn't look like he was going to beg off.

"No, I don't need a rescue|But a very powerful person ¨C notice I said "person" not "woman."'

'Those low blows,' Eric said. 'Like her erasing my tape - '

'The low blow,' the Mole interrupted, 'was not her erasing the tape. It was her refusing to tell you which one she had erased|"Gilmore Girls," Scout repeated, then made a sarcastic sound. Apparently done with studying, she glanced carefully around, then pulled a comic book from her bag. She paused to ensure the coast was clear, then sandwiched the comic between the pages of her trig book.

I arched an eyebrow at the move, but she shrugged happily, and went back to working trig problems, occasionally sneaking in a glazed-eyed perusal of a page or two of the comic|As much as she wished she could let go and give in to the tears, Drake needed her. She could feel how much he was suffering. His grief dwarfed hers, flowing over their connection in shuddering waves of agony. He'd loved Thomas like a brother and she'd only known him for one night. She wanted to be strong for Drake, to find a way to help ease his pain, and if she cried, she'd be useless|Bond had no intention of playing with the man again. And it was no good starting a you-did-I-didn't argument unless he caught Goldfinger doing something even more outrageous. Bond would just have to try and beat him, cheating and all.

Now Bond's twenty-foot putt was no joke. There was no question of going for the hole|She reattached the end of the scarf with one of the silver panthers. This time when she threw the spear, it caught. She tugged hard on the scarves to make sure it was secure. She needed to swing across the ditch without falling in.

She anchored the end of the scarf on her side with Carlos's backpack. She would wait till morning before attempting to cross the ditch|Just how was she to announce the breach of contract? "It seems the Marquess of Whitmore is not dead."

The earl said nothing. Instead he stared for quite a long time into the fire before answering, "Are you certain?"

"Quite. Why he even spoke to me, and I can assure you he was no ghost|“I didn’t say that,” Jackson answered, annoyed, “I was just making an observation.”  He looked thoughtfully up at the almost monkeys, and opened his notebook.  While he wrote in his notebook, Jane told Trey about the vote on who was leader.  
“If anyone should be leader,” he said, “I think I should.”  
“Never mind that now,” Emma said, “Maybe we just shouldn’t have a leader|I slowly rocked, replaying not just the last twenty-four hours over and over again, but the last three years. All those times I'd had a chance to figure out a way to contact the Covenant and hadn't. Missed opportunities. Chances I'd never get back. I could've tried to figure out how to reach the Covenant|The rocks were slicing her feet, and Tempest was beginning to feel desperate. There had to be a way out of this mess.

Behind her, she felt empty space under the heel of one foot. The rocky expanse ended abruptly on the edge of a cliff. She stood on that edge, over open air. She could feel the unstable dirt beneath her feet crumbling|“You can do this, Piper,” I heard Toryn yell. The crowd erupted in cheering, but I concentrated on Seraph. The platters leaned when I pulled one foot out and planted it in front of me. She nodded, and her encouragement surprised me. My hands were so wet I could no longer grip the bottom rim of the platter|Susannah wore a long, white lace bridal gown with an elegant scooped neckline, and her face was alight with a mischievous smile that reminded Olivia of Ivy. The picture must have been taken a long time ago, because all the colors in the picture were sort of brownish. Beside her, clutching her hand, stood the tall, broadshouldered groom in a black tuxedo with a skinny black bow tie. He had a huge black mustache and longish hair and was grinning toothily at the camera|"I can accept your position with regard to the Unfettered Poets," said Professor Vata, "As they possess neither talent nor training, and their work is meaningless. But if our gracious emperor chooses to support the poets of the university system..."
"It is no different at all," said Professor Kila. "A true mandarin composes poetry as a pastime, not a profession|I had a quick look yesterday from home and there was nothing too bad.  Is there anything new?’
	‘Not really.  Mr Walsh is asking what arrangements we are making to ensure his daughters are not in any danger, but surprisingly that’s the only one so far.  The others are all expressing concern and sympathy.’
	Mr Walsh was one of those parents who was always on the phone or on the doorstep|There was a statue of a thin-lipped man wearing a crown, who was standing on top of a man who appeared to be wearing a potato sack. Underneath the statue there was a sad-looking poppy in a soft patch of compost. Arthur pushed a hole in this ground and placed the berry there. When it needed to be pulled out, it would be a plant.
“I think I understand now,” said Arthur|He had no doubt they were the ones that snuck up to his tiny basement window each morning to wake him with their terrorizing chirps and cheeps.
The chirps and cheeps were already beginning, and Milt felt the throbbing in his head instantly increase. 
But I’m the zombie slayer now, he encouraged himself, surely I can take care of a few little birds. 
Milt drew his sword from its scabbard and raised it, pointing it directly at the birds|If I can manage to talk to them maybe I can--" He broke off. Belsnor turned toward the group of men to see what was happening. Ignatz Thugg held the gun. He had grabbed it away from Morley; now he held it pointed at Belsnor, a seedy, twisted grin on his face.

"Give it back," Seth Morley said to him; all of them were shouting at Thugg, but he stood unmoved, still pointing the gun at Belsnor|Should I make this change? I have the Tn’trith princeling almost here, I could tell him of my decision right now.”
“That would be unwise, sire.”
Ribeag looked up. That was a careful insult. A Tr’nah prince was never unwise. He may be uninformed by underlings, or knowledgeable in a manner that was unclear to those beneath him, but he was never unwise|Relief poured through her as she burrowed into him, feeling the solid strength of his muscles and the way her body fit against his. His warmth surrounded her, and his voice was raspy when he said her name, over and over again, into her hair. At first she thought she was shaking with fear and shock. Then she realized she wasn't the one shaking|Instantly, Isabella felt like a screaming bitch.

"Maybe you can scoop out the ice cream for dessert," she offered.

"We're having pudding?"Sally screeched and her effervescence so surprised and charmed Isabella that she couldn't stop herself from laughing.

"Yes, honey, you're having pudding," Isabella replied and stopped, glanced apprehensively at Prentice then back at Sally|He was at home sitting at the kitchen table with a big sandwich in front of him and his phone charging. His phone was endlessly happy to be alive again and was desperately getting as much gossip as possible and generally telling other phones that said Chase Darkstaar was with it at that very moment. 
He had decided that though he was not really Chase, nor really Jason, but an amalgam, that he would go by, and think of himself as Chase|Redding said, as Lin Ming raised herself up on an elbow and traced the contours of his face with her hand.
“You mean the man playing the cello?”
“No, I mean I was the cello.” He moved his arm back and forth as if he were holding an imaginary bow against his chest.
“Yes, I can see you as a cello|At the high school, the same lady as yesterday was sitting at the table for the senior registration. There was no one in line today. In fact there weren’t many people in the gym at all. Dylan and I made our way to the table. The lady looked at me at me and then at Dylan|Your mother was worried you would reject the offer if the time came.”
“Reject it?” I echo. “How could I? If the Guardians choose you to assume the throne then there’s nothing you can do but comply.”
“Of course there is,” she counters immediately. “You’re free to lead the life you want and no one has the right to stop you, not even the Guardians|Lottie exclaimed, as her sister, a beautiful woman in her late 20’s, with her hair in curls, wearing a Black and White polka-dotted dress and Black pumps walked up to them.
Lottie kissed her sister on the cheek, “Leah, I’d like you to meet Serena, my classmate.”
Leah. Serena thought, Could she be Tryke’s ex? “Hi,” Serena held out her hand for a handshake.
Lean smiled lightly and shook her hand, “Hi, Serena|“If you believe in it enough to risk your lives then I'll do anything you want.”
“Good,” said Carnac, and for some reason we all shook hands on it.
“Now for the details,” I said. “How are we going to start?”
“I can see only one way,” said Carnac|“I met you once when you sold me a car. I’m not buzzing you into my house.”
“I know Marc,” Carlos said.
“So does the milkman.”
“I’m invited to your wedding.” Carlos tried. “Remember, Carlos Rafael Wilson.”
“There might not even be a wedding|“Just can’t be.”
“I’m afraid it’s more than possible,” Constance said gently.  “Valeria is pregnant with Lorenzo’s child.”
“But he said he didn’t want to have children,” blurted Kate, tears streaming down her face with no direction.
“It seems Lorenzo said a lot of things he didn’t mean,” growled Constance|“You mean that you tend to the greenhouse.”
“No,” he said with a shiver of fear in his facial expression. “I do a lot of odd jobs with the School. I help them conduct tests on a lot of their new equipment. I just use the greenhouse as the place for many of those tests|I'm having a luncheon here. And since you were so rude the other day, I never got to finish my discussions with Nancy so I could arrange for the menu. Not very nice of you, Sophie dear."

Sophie gritted her teeth against the patronizing tone Evelyn was using.

"Yet another bad choice of clothes, Sophie|As I prayed, I suddenly noticed a young man who was sitting in the next pew, staring at me. He was blonde and blue-eyed, about eighteen years old. He smiled at me in a friendly manner. I ignored him at first, intent upon saying my prayers. When the service ended, he surprised me my walking over to my pew|The person’s silence puzzled him as he began to unwrap the long slender item. In the center of the fabric he found a bow that was broken in two places. Fanchon looked up and tried to see the face hidden in the shadows of the hooded cloak. The figure gestured to the broken bow.
“You expect me to repair the bow|Nick, who had been keeping tabs with paranoid glee, made this his cue: “writer. Lucky is a very talented, thrice-published author.”
“published?”
“yes.”
“what publisher?”
Nick beamed. “Random House.”
this seemed to do the trick, and Michael smiled. “that’s great that you’re doing so well for yourself, Lucky|"Well, I'm glad I didn't have to meet her."

But you didn't get to see me, I think. I keep it to myself.

We press our knees together under the table. My hands find hers and we hold them there. We talk as if none of this is happening, as if we can't feel life pulse through all the spots where we're touching|“It will be looking good in that dustbin,"he said and threw it there,"take care because now we will only had to hear that heart breaking sound"Goku said,but Farhan didn't hear and moved into the bus for keeping that bag on the first seat as demanded by the mad man.
"Today that Gilani will be making everyone feared with his cannons", as I said this the whole team came out,"good morning mam"Goku said when Priyanshi came to climb on to the bus|“I’ll let you know what we uncover.” 
“I’ll be on tender hooks, Bean, awaiting the report,” Johnny B replied. 
“The word is tenterhooks, Johnny B.”
“What are tenterhooks?”
“What are tender hooks?”
“Pins and needles then, okay, Bean|"And when was it that you were sleeping, Johnson? For that matter, when were any of us?"
Johnson thought about it. Had they been awake for fourteen days? Not possible, he told himself. He Looked over at Beeker. Beeker just smiled.
"None of us have. None of us have to, unless he makes us... Don't you get it yet, Johnson|Now if you could -]"
Keeble dug in his pocket and pulled out the money Colin and Mona had given him. "Me fix plane." He forced the notes into the dwarf's hand.
"[You want to pay me to let you fix a plane? What, are you kidding?]"
"Me watch. Learn. Fix plane."
"[Look, you'd need to pay me more than twenty three pounds to let you near one of my planes|I waited, but she didn't breathe in again.

I opened my eyes and rolled over onto my back, listening intently. I inhaled quickly when the silhouette appeared next to my bed.

"Sara?" I questioned. "Is something wrong?"

She didn't move. Maybe she was sleepwalking. I propped myself up on my elbows, trying to focus on her and asked again, "Sara|The sisters of renunciation were crooning a hymn to the Void which spoke of rest and eternal peace, and Rosa joined in, singing soft and sweet. 
Suddenly he heard another voice inside his head, and it spoke very differently: 
‘Don’t be a fool! Did I not warn you of the apples?’ It was the Old Man of Avalon. And Calibur remembered the Goddess, and the beauty of Life and all its forms rushed in a glorious vision before his eyes, and he knew he could not slander it, though it stung him with a thousand stings|I feel myself starting to blush as the two of them stare me down, waiting for my response.
“Yeah, definitely head in the clouds right now,” I say, then look up at Holly. “I didn’t even know you saw us sitting together.”
“Oh, yeah, I was watching to see if he was gonna sit with Summer, because it was obvious what she was doing…”
“Wait,” Becca interrupts, her eyes zipping between me and Holly|He shoved his c**k up into his lover, grinning when Ty called out his name and turned his head to try for a kiss. Zane curled and managed to meet his lips, reaching around Ty's body, gripping his c**k and stroking him. How was Ty still riding him with his body so contorted|"But you don't like it," he said, his voice hard.

"No."

He sighed harshly. "Then tell me where we go from here."

Ruth wished she knew. "I can't answer that."

His eyes pleaded with her. "I can't answer it for you, Ruth|To my horror, Beth knocks on my brother's door without asking if I'm ready. Any hope Mark would be in class ends when the doorknob jiggles and Mark's large, looming figure stands in the door frame.

Beth flashes a wicked smile. "S'up, Mark.

How was the game against Florida?"

He hesitantly grins as his eyes flicker between me and Beth|Seven trips later, we had all Simon's stuff inside, my arms were like Jell-o and Simon had not only fixed the squeaky bed, but had tightened the screws on all the chairs and re-arranged all the bookshelves. He was like a one man Extreme Makeover Home Edition team. All he needed was a megaphone and a tape measure.

Will had given up and gone to get pizza after the third trip to the car, the slacker.

"How freaking long does it take to get pizza|Badly. He apparently locked himself in his room,” Jeff said, leaning in to Ben and almost whispering. “Riley found him and called out after you had already come in here.”

Ben looked away from Jeff, fearing what he would say next.

“He came back as one of those things, Ben|Fitch sat for a moment, then finally he sighed and reached out to sketch a copy of the looping swirl on the desk.

Nothing happened.

Joel held his breath. Minutes ticked by. Still nothing. He walked nervously over to the desk. "Did you draw it right?"

"Hum. Well, I think so," Fitch said, holding up the sketch|I needed that levity more than ever, and Mia provided it. And I suppose now is no different. I like that she doesn't act her age.

"Come on. I'll let you go first down the slide," she says.

"Let me, huh?" I lift one eyebrow. I pick her up and set her down on the top of the slide|A straight bladed one, like a stiletto or a Medieval dagger. Perhaps we could get that in Medina as well."
By this time their belongings were loaded into the car.
"Are you driving first or shall I?" Gill asked Alan and Manjy.
"I'd rather navigate," said Alan|"She looks just like you."

"What do you mean?" Amanda's heart was pounding and she was a little freaked out, if anyone cared.

"Her hair is twisted up..." Piper's hands spun around the crown of her own head. "And her face is rounder, but she looks like you, Amanda|And until that day I was keeping my mouth shut.

When training was finished, Sam, Cole and I walked back to the house and I was surprised to see my mother's car parked beside the house.

"That's my cue to leave," Cole said, looking at her car.

"You don't have to go, Cole|"You're cute when you pout."

Cute. That was definitely not what I wanted to be thought of. Cute was for puppies, kittens, and little girls. Now I really pouted.

"Oh, more pouting. I must have said something wrong. Let me guess. You don't want me to call you cute|Last year we had to get out the ‘copter to find a couple of tourists who got lost in a cornfield on the Francis farm.  Scared them silly.”

I grabbed his leash and dragged him out of the field|Once inside Mark settled her on the couch and gave her a glass of water. Emma took a small sip and then set it aside before stretching out on the couch. 
“Emma.” Mark said softly. “Are you okay?”
Emma shook her head. “No Mark, I’m not okay|“I see you haven’t cleared the hospital yet,” I say. 
“We go in as needed,” he says. “We are a small group. We are tactical…smart.”
“How many people?” I ask. 
“Just over fifty.”
“Are you their leader?”
“We don’t really have a leader|How was it Julio who convinced her to come clean?

"Leah's tougher than she thinks," Julio says as he puts his arm around her shoulder. "She can do this." He squeezes her shoulders and looks into her eyes. "You can do this."

"You've known my sister all of three days, Julio|It's not that I didn't want him to come, but I needed to take some time and slow things down. I also didn't want to deal with my mom's reaction yet.

"Could you quit making those lovey dovey faces? It's making me sick." Hailey playfully punched my arm.

"I am not making a lovey dovey face|“This was a lovely night, was it not?”
They reached the sidewalk and she noticed that Connie was inside the house.  “Kiss me.”
He chuckled.  “What?”
“I want you to kiss me, and not one of those polite kisses either.  Show me how you feel for me in the kiss|just occasionally, she wondered whether it might have been a good idea. 'Curtain up in an hour and a half,' said Nanny. 'I promised Giselle I'd give her a hand...'

'Who's Giselle?'

'She does makeup.'

'You don't know how to do makeup|All the familiar landmarks were there: Magdalen, Amaurotic House, the Residence of the Suzerain, the Hawksmoor-and Port Meadow. I peeled the map from the wall and studied it. The printed letters next to it were mangled, but I made them out.

Train.

My fingers tightened on the edges of the map|Candy grabbed the phone. They could all hear her through the phone. “Grandmother, we won’t have a good time at all unless you come, too. We’d probably be crying instead of having a good time.” She only exaggerated slightly.
Chrissy took the phone. “We all want you to come, too, Grandmother|One or two of the tribemates in the distance didn't seem to be super chipper-Shanna held her head in her hands, probably the result of overindulging last night.

I glanced over at Dean. He lay in the bed looking up at me with an amused expression, his other arm tucked under his head. Beneath him, a thick bed of palm leaves had been crushed and trampled-probably by the rest of the tribe|“Stop.”
Logan catches my wrist, pulling me to him faster than I can take a breath. “Willow,” he says, cupping my cheek. His gaze captures mine, a dark void that makes me feel like I’m falling. 
I find my voice. “Don’t do that to me, Logan|“Over there!” I reply, jumping up and down.
“For heaven’s sake, calm down, Sarah,” says Uncle Marty, gripping my arm.
“Uncle Marty! That man is evil! I’m telling you!”
“What man? There are a thousand men in here, Sarah|The two riders nodded, both smiling cruelly at the young nobleman, who was still visibly shaken. 
“Good. The rest of us will camp here tonight, and at first dawn tomorrow we’ll follow the tracks. If they do go off the trail, or bypass the Outpost, I’ll send Queltin for you. And no funny business,” he added, glowering at the two riders|"I'm glad you think so." His eyes captured hers in an intense gaze, and her heart nearly stalled as she continued walking beside him. Being fully aware that she was getting too caught up in the moment didn't help her heart flutter any less. This wasn't going according to plan, but she was having a hard time caring|Just put it in my closet, and I'll go through it someday."

"Oh, ok," she said as she headed to the bedroom. She came back out a few minutes later, holding my guitar. "Aren't you going to keep this out?"

I looked at her and then at the guitar|She looked a little disoriented but handed it over and set her purse on the table so he could slide the coat over her arms and onto her shoulders.

Although manners had been heavily ingrained in Aidan since a young age, he wasn't in the habit of lying to himself. Manners hadn't been his main reason for helping her with the coat|Madame Duguay clicks her tongue. “Come,” she takes my arm, “you can help me with a few chores.”
Great.

With Troy and Uncle Marty gone to the dig site, the house is quiet. Madame Duguay’s in the garden out back. She’s left me alone now that I’ve helped her with her chores|Captain Porter counted the twelve boys on at one end before making for his own single compartment at the near end of the carriage.  Pip, for once slow on the uptake, realised that his first plan to share a compartment was not going to happen.  Sacha was already being towed into a compartment with Peter firmly gripping him by his wrist to stop any further discussion on the subject.  As Pip walked down the narrow corridor he found himself pulled inside one of the compartments|Then in an obvious effort to change the subject, he pulled a small tube out of his pocket.  It looked like lip gloss.  "Here, you should use this before going to the meeting I scheduled for you this afternoon."
"What is it?" asked Blake with a frown as he took the tube|Kimber isn't feeling well, so we thought it best if she was in her own room tonight, so you don't get sick too."

"She's sick?"

The teacher's aide nodded emphatically. "Poor thing can't hold anything down."

Is that why she seemed out of it earlier, because she was sick|"After grinding your regular convex lens..."
" . . . instead of turning the lens over and polishing it flat, you create a concave lens within the convex one . . ."
Hansum repeated the operation of polishing a concave shape within the convex one.
"You are talking foolishly," the Master contested. "If the lens is the same shape on both the outside and inside, it will be as if it is flat|Something she would tell a stranger.

"I'm Charlotte," I say, feeling my life drain out of me. "I'm your best friend."

She steps back and laughs softly, probably trying to discern if I'm joking.

"Best friends? I think I'd remember that, Charlotte|Blake nodded at the nurse. "Get him."

The nurse nodded in agreement then looked at her. "The doctor really should see you," she said, then went and picked up the wall telephone as Samantha glanced at Blake.

He gave a short shake of his head. "He's paid to do his job, Samantha|She located a socket and plugged in her charger, then connected the phone.  She called Allison.
“I’ve been calling you all morning!  Where have you been?” shouted Allison.
“Sorry, I’m okay, no need to yell.  The police placed me in a safe house,” said Katrina.
“My parents are freaked out, they don’t want me to come back today,” said Allison|Instead of eating at the counter or table, we make a picnic on the living room floor laughing, drinking beer, and eating until our stomachs are about to explode.

I don't want to bring up Bryn, but I can't stop the words from leaving my mouth.

"Is there something going on with you and Bryn|"Glad to see me?"

Glad wasn't the word he'd use. Stunned would be about right. When Maggie had left, she'd sworn that he would never see her again. And he hadn't, not counting the nights she appeared in his dreams just to torment him.

"What are you doing here, Maggie|I had a paralyzing sense of discomfort, and it was not due to the metallic wire around my neck: it was, as I had witnessed many times before, very difficult for me to walk more than a few steps without turning and facing a new direction because I'd been so strongly conditioned to pacing within the well-defined confines of the vault.  I had the overwhelming urge to stop and turn around, but I was unable to appease this urge because they were herding me away from the vault|Cameron was summoned first, and he walked by Ewan with a look of smug satisfaction. It wasn't just the snideness that bothered Ewan. It was the supreme confidence in both look and manner. Cameron was a man who feared not the outcome of today's hearing.

Caelen put his hand on Ewan's shoulder. "No matter what happens, we're with you, Ewan|I never have."

He spun her around. "You're worth more than all those people put together. Your parents and mine."

"Who's that woman you liked touching so much?" she asked. He detected a note of jealousy in her voice.

"Why, little Petal, are you jealous|"Look," Halle said, pointing to the pillar of smoke in the air. "That's our house."

"No going back now even if we wanted to."

"I don't want to anyway," Halle said.

"If something happens to me, you keep going," I said.

"Jenna-"

"I'm serious, Halle|"And after that," Elena said to Bonnie, "you said one more thing, in a strange voice. You said not to go near the bridge."

"She toldyou not to go near the bridge."

Meredith corrected. "You in particular, Elena. She said Death was waiting."

"I don't care what's waiting," said Elena|There were a few more lines about his eyes and forehead, his bobbed gray doctor's wig looked new, and his mouth was more pinched than she remembered it, but it was her papa.

He stared at her but didn't smile. "May I come in?"

"Of course."

He climbed in the carriage and sat across from them. His coat, waistcoat, and breeches were black, making him very somber. He didn't seem to know what to do now that he was in the carriage|She knew there would be pitfalls and tears. But she also knew that the biggest worry she had ever had, what would happen to Tommy when he was an adult, was now tempered with hope. They had a place, and finally, Willow could envision a world full of possibilities.

Wren Schwind is a mother of two, one with autism|He ransacked the penny dreadfuls in his head, trying to remember if any of their heroes had visited Australia. "A kangaroo," he said. "And opals," he added. He was fairly sure about the opals.

Victoria Forester squeezed his hand. "And whatever would I do with a kangaroo|I'm just running back to the site for a few more drinks."

She turned and waved goodbye before they even had a chance to reply.

"See what I mean?" Finley asked, startling me.

"Huh?"

"She hates me," she explained.

"Oh, I'm most definitely sure that wasn't because of you, Finley|We don’t have time to lose,” Gralso said, gripping her head in his hands and shaking it. Gralso inspected her; she was partly ripped from her chair. It wasn’t a good sign, but Gralso knew she would heal. The adrenaline made Gralso forget about the previous events.
“I’ll just have to drag you then,” Gralso said, and began to free Idalina from the rest of the chair|I was just hoping that you didn’t go straight to the pub from work.”
I remember standing in my apartment that last day and looking out the window. I saw a guy walking down my street who seemed to be interested in my apartment building but that guy did not look like Kelly. At least I do not think he looked like Kelly|A lot of caravans flow between here and there.”
“State your name and your business, travelers,” one of the men said.

“What business do you have in Oasis|I’m going to miss you kids very much, you know?”
She caught Candy to her and hugged her tight. Soon they were both sniffling and Chrissy reached for her box of tissues. “I think we should have bought an extra case of tissues. At the rate we’re going we might need them."
“It won’t seem right without you here any more, Chrissy|"We may have limited food and water but it appears we've got no shortage of testosterone around here. As I was saying, my friend's code was amazing. It made simple data transfers over the web take half as much time - a revolutionary new compression algorithm. But just as I was experimenting with it, my boss decided Microtech should have it all to itself|"Okay," I responded with a huge smile, turning my camera on and exploring its new features so I'd be ready when it was time.

When the television crew cleared out, I grabbed Jack and his family and posed them in the backyard, under a giant oak tree. I took a few group family shots and then individual ones.

"Let me take one of you and Jack, dear. Do you trust me to use your camera|"That thing's going to shatter everywhere!"

The statue soars up and up, scraping along the clear sides of the grav tube as the tube curves along the contours of the ship.

His was a roaming soul. That was why he did not go back to Ireland|He's a good man." Sebastian gave Carl a chuckle and lightly tapped him on his shoulder. "You'll see that he just kind of fades into the background and you get used to it. He's here to keep us safe, Elena."

"It's nice to meet you, Carl|“What do you mean ‘no one would’ve looked anyway’?” Sam shook his head at her berating tone.
She kept her face fixed away from him and went back to staring out the window. “I don’t look like Elle. I’m not deluded or anything. I know what I look like, Sam|Gave your mother a house in which you could sleep at night." He picked up a doll and turned it over, stared at it, then replaced it on the shelf. "You liked the house where you lived with your mother, didn't you?"

He turned and looked at her with the same expression on his face he'd had when he examined the doll|The restaurant was packed with locals as well as a few tourists. Everyone seemed to be enjoying the food and all engaged in excited chatters.

"Hi, Elise," Gabriel said, taking the stuffed fox from Summer and setting it on a nearby counter. The bridge of his nose flushed. Was he embarrassed at being caught with her? He glanced at Summer with a pleading look in his eyes, before turning his attention back to Elise|Eloisa rushed to the telephone in the living room as the rest followed her.  
“Wayne's phone is disconnected!” Eloisa burst as she put the receiver back on the cradle.
“Caramba, do you know where he lives?” asked Doña Chona with desperation in her voice.
“No, I don't,” responded Eloisa|I guess we could go ask Grizzard if he knows where the merchant lives.”
“Who’s Grizzard? Why didn’t you mention him before?”
“He’s an old rogue who lives in the alley.”
“Dagdron, you should’ve revealed that information during the first steps of the quest!”
“Which step? I was a little confused about steps two, three, and sixteen so maybe that’s why I forgot|And all the time Jason was working to be a better man for his fiancee?

That made Cab the villain. He didn't like that much.

"We'll settle for the hour-and-a-half tour|"Run, freak, run!" Stacy yells as I dash through the field. How cliche.

Brynn was sure that was true.

He rose to his feet and, standing on the desk, turned his back to Prentiss. What had seemed merely a shining black cuticle suddenly split and lifted. From underneath, two filmy, veined wings fluttered out.

"Oh, you can fly," said Prentiss|She sniffed, thinking to herself that she should have listened to Sisila when she heard footsteps coming right at her. 
She ducked her head deeper into the bush, hoping to hide her shame, but then she looked up as Hastin asked, “What are you doing?”
She stared up at him. “I’m just watching,” she said, still sniffling as she rose out of the bush|"Screw the assignment."

Mia blinked at his tone.

"Mia, you're pushing yourself too hard."

"Says the self-made millionaire." She pushed the empty juice glass away. "I have to push myself hard. I have to get my business running."

"I wasn't pregnant when I made my millions|Anyway, to make a long story short, she wanted to check the studios on the off chance that someone might be available. And you'll never guess what happened."

"Tell me," I said.

Jane popped the last of the mushroom into her mouth, letting the anticipation build. The tips of her fingers were shiny as she reached for another mushroom|Maybe Dave tried to present himself as a paragon of virtue, but Mike knew he generally did whatever he could get away with. "Why is his contact with your mother of more interest than anyone else's?"

"Because he could be my father."

That took a moment to sink in. Her father? Mike had always just accepted that Lucky had no father. He'd never dreamed that it could be someone well-known, someone who was married at the time she was conceived|I have always had a fascination for antiques and collectibles.”
“Oh, this old thing?” Julia returned to rummaging around in the desk drawer. “I cannot find that key. I know I put it in here.” Ronni could see that she was growing frantic. “I never take it out of this drawer|'Well, she was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put it into her own hands, but I gave it into Barrymore's hands, and he promised to deliver it at once.' 
'Did you see Ms. Barrymore?' 
'No, sir; I tell you she was in the loft.' 
'If you didn't see her, how do you know she was in the loft|Their other gift was a hand held electronic game that Chrissy suggested. Penny had to go into the library and lock the door in order to be sure she didn’t get caught wrapping them. Ed had made each of them a beautiful toy box, too, to keep all their toys in. Penny had them all locked up in the library so they would be a surprise|“By the way, Elizabeth asked if I’d seen you,” Tony lied. He wanted Jon to leave so he could talk with Ezekiel alone. There was something that Aunt Casey, Patella and Gabriella had said about Tom that had bothered him ever since meeting Ezekiel earlier that afternoon.
“I’m sure she’ll find me,” Jon remarked curtly, trying to cut short the conversation with Tony|Joranum sat back in his chair and looked at Raych for an extended time. It was almost possible to hear his thoughts buzzing.

Finally he said, "Suppose he is a robot, young man. Why should you care? Does it matter to you?"

"Of course it matters to me," said Raych|Twenty-one

The homeless man was curled up in the limited shelter of the motel's dimly lit breezeway. He had covered himself with a ragged purple blanket and an insulating layer of newspapers. Zack stopped a short distance away. The man's face was hidden by the blanket pulled up over his head. The sole of one running shoe poked out from beneath the lower edge of a newspaper|However, these links will take you to blogs, websites and news articles that provide photographs and information that could enhance your enjoyment of this novel. There are also nine links to songs enjoyed by the main characters in the story. Clicking on the name of the song will open a video on most devices.

"Miss McLean, Shoshone isn't a person, it's a language. It's the language spoken by several Native American tribes from around this region. Senior Airman Dongoske here is from one of those tribes|"Summerhall is south. Your father".

"The Wall is north".

Dunk looked at him. "That's a long way to ride".

"I have a new horse, ser".

"So you do". Dunk had to smile. "And why would you want to see the Wall|“I’m sorry, I didn’t catch your name, miss…”
She smiled. “I never gave it.”
The phone buzzed again. Paul thought about turning it off.
“You may call me Helen,” she said graciously.
“Helen.” The name rang in his mind like a bell. “Um, where do you live, Helen|"It all sounds a bit crazy to me. Could it be simply some kind of ruse to get me away from the artifact study?"
"I don't think so," said Ed. "My, but you are the suspicious sort, aren't you?"
"I'm NSA. And I'm also the sort of man that likes to be sure about what's going on around him, Ed|Anyway, I’m borrowing this phone, so you won’t be able to call back. Um, can you just come over here? And we’ll figure out what we’ll do? I guess I need a place to stay. Anyway, okay, I hope to see you soon.”
Chloe ended the call and noticed the brand icon. “I thought you said this was a Pantech phone|As the viewscreen snapped into focus to show a closer view of the area, they could see that a bright lance of light had shot from the nose of the alien ship and remained suspended in space, reaching out to rest upon the nose of the Indomitable.
“Dex, what is that?” asked the Admiral.
“I don’t know, sir,” replied Dex|She could see by the look in her eyes that she was almost scared of what was written in it, as if her mother would spill all of her secrets. Not that her mom had secrets. At least Scout didn’t think she did. Grace seemed to be a very normal mom. She ran training schools for her company and traveled often, but other than that, she didn’t stand out from the other moms|Paul's plate was mostly empty; just a few stray chips remained when the two men walked in. The werewolf scented him, just as he did the same. He motioned the man over. The werewolf grabbed the arm of the human male with him, dragging him over to Paul's booth.

"Have a seat," Paul nodded toward the opposite, empty side of his booth|"Heavens, you must have skeletons jumping out of closets all over the place."

His mouth hooked up at one side. Cute.

He crossed his arms. "Any skeletons in your closet, Ms. Quinn?"

"We all have secrets, although they're rarely of interest to anyone else."

"I have a feeling I'd be interested in yours|Meredith slid onto a bar stool, her leather pants somehow not sticking to it and causing her to fall off. “Two drinks please.”
“What do you want?” The barman shifted his shoulder, indicating the splendid array of dark liquors behind him. Even though the lighting was suitably gloomy, Anna could still make out some of the titles written on the bottles|“Does he always know when you’re coming home?”
“No. He probably heard us talking in the hallway.”
“You’re probably right.” She leaned down and massaged Bagel’s ears and he dropped the leash and smiled up at her. “You ready to go for a walk, are you, Bagel|He had said the same thing to Amma in the swamp, that I had some kind of power. It just didn't make sense, even to me. I wasn't one of them, that much I knew. I wasn't a Caster.

Arelia looked up at Macon. "You can Bind the house all you want, Macon|This was why he wore rough, scratched jeans, why his denim jacket bore so many marks and scrapes, and why his climbing boots had long ago lost their new leather lustre. No matter how many times he got them cleaned or repaired, or bought new clothes, his gear would always look ragged and shabby.
In the end, you learned to take pride in the ragamuffin look|I ordered a BLT without incident.

Leon ordered a milk shake without incident. When his shake arrived, he cradled it in his hands, savoring it. He seemed to regard it as a guilty indulgence, something only permitted in the middle of the night with a stranger.

He looked glum, which wasn't the point of this exercise, so I asked, "So, Leon|'I'd say most of my physical features,' Nick mocked.

'True, dear, but that's not what I meant and you know it. Don't be tiresome. He wrote me that the necklace was a token of gratitude for having borne him such an impressive son. Obviously, if Enrique was pleased with you, he'd leave you much more than a necklace|He had my left arm, so I took my right hand, and started punching him in the face. It was doing little to no damage, though. I knew had to get out of there, and help everybody else, though. I turned my desperation into adrenaline, and slugged Shortie as hard as I could. His grip faltered, and I reared back, and hit him as hard as I could again|The guy this morning was just as cute as Alex and I just had a vision of Brandon kissing me when I met him, you know, like I did when I met Alex.”
“Ahhh …” Jillian laughed. “Alex has competition.”
“Jillian, get serious. That’s not what is going on. I’m going out with Alex. I don’t know what happened with Brandon|"Sad is when you lose your daughter before marriage." Her mother drove her words home by meeting her daughter's eyes as she said, "I do hope you enjoy your new family more than you did ours."

Instant tears clogged Zhang's throat. "Mother ..."

Chin held high with pride, her mother said, "Please don't deny it, Zhang|And how much did Misty have to f**king suffer because of his wrongdoing? He lowered himself until he could whisper into Misty's ear, "I'm sorry. But you cannot vote because we are not mated."

She jerked away from him, and Domenico couldn't fault her.

Misty looked back at the other pack leaders, knowing that they were also aware of why she couldn't vote|I told them I'd get you to sign it tomorrow."
Mr. White nodded. "You know," he said, "I think I may just drive in and sign it tonight. I need a drive to jog my mind."
"They’ll be closed."
"Well, call someone and make sure it’s open|And seeing them, standing close together, Clay's eyes on Maggie's down turned face, their bodies angled toward each other as though they couldn't resist the other's pull, I could admit it was sort of beautiful.

So, maybe it was the alcohol talking, but I think I liked Clay right then. Because I could see how much he cared about Maggie|He always loved holidays at the beach. But in the last few years, the eyes had turned cold and impersonal. They were like that now.
"They let me go," Reid shrugged.
"I see," Ashleigh answered in a neutral voice. "I'm pleased for you, Reid|But he also spent some of the night showing me the vault beneath the church, which opened by means of a ring handle on a trapdoor, faced in stone, the ring itself fitted down flat beneath what appeared to be only one of many marble inlaid ornaments in the floor tiles.

I knew of these crypts but had been whipped for sneaking into them when I was a child, and my father had told me back then how disappointed in me he'd been that I couldn't keep a family secret.

That admonition had hurt far more than the whipping|There were cars just outside the sandstone pillars. Parked cars. They must have driven up sometime during the fight with Suzanne, while the roar of the fire blocked out the sound of their engines, while Thea's attention was focused on the wraith trying to Ml her.

Because the people were already out of the cars|“Ha, so the mother-in-law approves,” said McKenzie. He clapped his hands.
“I’m going back to work,” said Tuan. He stood up and said to Ana, “Please keep me posted. I will visit again tonight.” He exited the room.
McKenzie produced an envelope from his suit pocket, and handed it over to Ana|Consumed by my sorrow, I barely noticed the fleeting movement against my hand. It came again, and I held my breath as something warm touched my skin for a second. A mouse maybe. Animals were not afraid of me; it wasn’t unusual for one to come up to me.
Another touch came, but this time it was not warm|Trying to make things add up.
“No, Ananda, with an n.”
“Wait here.”
The man thought of closing the door, but didn’t. Then he vanished. Ananda could hear him call out: “Melissa. Someone here to see you.” Then again, and louder this time, “Melissa|Harlin asked taking cover behind a tree trunk near Dean’s location.
“I asked for assistance, and then this yellow gata came flying,” Dean said.
“Okay, focus a controlled burst in the direction of fire?” Harlin ordered.
“It’s coming from everywhere sir,” Admin said.
“Pick one point of origin,” said Harlin|It was not a long journey, ten minutes or so, and when the convent came into view, I nodded to the conductress, who rang the bell to stop the bus. I had seen some people hopping on and off while the vehicle was still moving, but I did not feel brave enough to try that.
When it came to a halt, I stepped down onto the pavement and looked across the square to where the two bell-towers, with their golden domes, rose above the church that formed the front of the convent|In all my years of knowing Levi, I'd never crossed him that way. I'd also never gotten myself into such a ridiculously dumb situation.

"I assume you have an explanation." He sat in an Adirondack chair, giving me a look that was half annoyance and half pity. I could handle the annoyance but not the pity|I then grab the laptop, close it and put it in my rucksack. Pacing to the bathroom I slip on the rucksack and pull out the gun. Inside the bathroom I leave the door wide open and conceal myself behind it.
A loud, confident knock on the front door. A ten second pause followed by the exact same knock|His face was twisted with anguish. "My sons will die the way men died before, and for what?"

Avigail came in with Silent Hannah, and the usual following of little ones.

"Please no more talk of this," said my aunt Esther.

"My father says the world has gone to Caesarea," said Avigail|It was as if he was looking at one of those pictures within a picture and not seeing the intended image. If only he could sweep away all the garbage and peer inside Karen, he could determine what was going on.

Two blocks from his single-story two-bedroom home, he noticed Tracey's car parked outside his driveway.

Once again, with his attention focused on Karen, he'd forgotten all about Tracey|“I have proof that these types of men can’t be rehabilitated. I have proof that that these types of men have the culture of hate for Men of Color imbedded in their hardened hearts.”  Julian Moore scooped up Xavier’s shirt from the floor and handed it back to him. After he put it back on Julian said to the warden, while never taking his eyes off Xavier|He was calculating, though what he was calculating Gnak could not be certain. Perhaps he was weighing risk against reward. Maybe he was thinking of ways to capture a giant. All that mattered to Gnak was that the king was thinking about it and he was not yet dead.
“What will you do with the giant|"Do you remember the condition of her body?"

"Not really. I mean, not details or anything."

"Do you remember who identified her?"

"You didn't?"

"No."

Harper scratched his temple. "Her father, wasn't it?"

"Do you remember how long it took for him to make an identification|“Yes.”
“You should be born in a non English-speaking country. Sweden, or some such place,” answered Flannery. “Very few foreign born writers have achieved prominence in English. Each one of them was certainly noticed.”
“Whom?”
“Nabokov,” for example,” said Flannery|You can tell me anything and it will stay between us."

"There's nothing to talk about, Ridley. Seriously."

"You don't have to pretend with me, Aisha."

"I'm not pretending," she said, laughing nervously.

"Seriously, I might know-"

"Ridley|She began to pick up bits of conversation from the men near her.
“We should burn ‘er here. No need to drag ‘er all the way ta home.”
“Talk to Jeb. He’ll figger it out.”
“He better.”
“He will. He’s gotta good head, thet Jeb|I grabbed the handle of the door, yanked it open and Kiyu jumped through. I was only a half second behind her, but Kiyu had already pinned the six Blackthumbs against the wall. Arms and legs were bent at odd angles and backs arched painfully over slung crossbows. The Blackthumbs groaned and one of them screamed in terror as he stared at Kiyu|"Oh, wow."

"Let's go." Harry pulled me towards the front door.

"Don't squeeze Katie's hand off, Harry," Brandon chuckled as we walked through the front door.

"I'm not." He laughed and smiled up at me. "I'm not hurting you, am I, Katie|It reminded him of what he had done, and he only wished he had the conscience to view it as a punishment rather than simply an annoying smell.  He paid for his food with a debit card from a bank account that seemed always to honour the transaction.  He had an idea that he’d had a good job once|“That’s a dumb name Let’s call him George,” Leon said.
“George? That’s not a cat’s name. He looks like a tiger; he needs a strong name.”
“Oh, and Stripes is a strong name?”
“Stop it guys, but I think you’re right, he does look like a tiger|"What's that supposed to mean?" I snapped, worried about where this conversation was going.

"I found the empty bottles while you showered. I knew you drank, but it seems excessive." Only Shayna would have found the evidence that quickly. In another life, she could have been a detective|The two men enter the controlled access doors and walk down a long corridor together. Stan notices the badge that Evens has dangling from a cord around his neck. It is colored green with his picture, some computer punched holes, and is laminated in plastic. Stan asks, “Gee how do I get a badge like that?” 
Evens smiles and says, “Believe me, Stan|"But once a heart is broken, it takes more than just someone willing to fix it for the mend to take place."

Sofia leaned back against the soft leather seat. "And what is that? What does it take?"

Hunter glanced out the window just as Ash's horse trotted up alongside the carriage. "My dear, one must desire to be fixed|The writing was messy, but clear, and two edges of the heavy piece of paper were jagged, ripped from a larger section. Teria wondered if it had been torn from the flyleaf of some book. On the side opposite of the message were Gaent and Teria's names, first and last, as well as "Bayside Precinct, Kenos."
"I don't think we have moth's chance in a crow's nest of getting into the Library with this," said Teria|She can go ahead of anyone else who is waiting,” Dr. Levinson said to a nurse who sat behind the counter.
Greta nodded and Gracy went through.
The back room was just as Gracy had remembered it from months before. She sat on the examining table and looked at Dr. Levinson.
“So what is going on, Gracy|Both men were exhausted from the long walk, and the lack of sleep.
‘How’s the wound?’ asked Matt.
‘The infection’s spreading. We’re running out of time,’ Kassim placed the meat between his teeth and tore a piece off.
‘We’ll just have to push on then. I’ll go and repack the horse,’ said Matt|"He doesn't talk much," Nyelle explains, stepping into the next cubicle.

"And that's funny, since that's what we're paid to do." She unwraps two headsets and plugs them into a phone before logging on to the computer.

"Here, you can use the training set," she says, handing me one of the headsets|In the batting of an eyelash, the chubby little boy sitting beside his mother in the family pew becomes a middle-aged man cowering in the dark. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies...

"Good, Burns," he murmured. "Very good."

"Thank you, sir," said Burns|Leaving the portrait on one side of the screen, he called up one of the landscapes from Andrews’ gallery window. It had reminded him of Francesco Moretti’s work and out of curiosity he wanted to run a Moretti against the Andrews to check the similarities and differences. From the online library, he retrieved a Moretti with a similar setting and placed it on the screen alongside the other two paintings|So let’s get right to it, shall we? 
Finn Daley: Okay?
Anchor/Kiki Stuart: I want to know — I think we all want to know — what has brought you out of hiding to be with all us on this beautiful day? 
Finn Daley: Good question.
Anchor/Kiki Stuart: Now don’t be coy with me, Finn|The boy was leaning forward in his seat, squinting. My sharp gasp had gotten him to take my enterprise seriously, though there was no fear in his expression. Because there was no fear, I was forced to accept the impossibility that Marshall was blind to what was so clear to me.
“How could you not see that, Marshall|But maybe we shouldn't talk about that witch,' said Jennifer.

`We're better now.  It was good for us to have that cry, to get it out of our systems,' said Kayla.

`Sounds like you've had some nightmares,' said Jennifer.

`No, it was a real witch,' said Kayla|****

Lily glanced down at her children unwrapping their Christmas presents. Wayne sat in the chaos of wrapping paper as he helped his son and daughter unwrap a present George had given them. Her father loved using cello tape. Most of his gifts were covered in an even layer of the stuff. She chuckled when they became frustrated and went for scissors|She liked Yurik a lot, but she was probably doing it more for survival than for any romantic sentiment.
“I bet you yourself don’t even know why,” said Tuan sharply. Zoe was stunned to hear it.
Tuan continued to say, “The time is changing I guess. Some Vietnamese girls are living with their boyfriends, too, especially in the cities|"We've never had a girl drum major."

This took a few seconds to sink in. "Walter," I said in awe.

"I know, I know," he said. "I know all about my own eye-hurting brilliance."

I waited for him to ruin it by suggesting some way I could repay him for his eye-hurting brilliance|"I guess you're right." She let out a long, sorrowful sigh. "I'm starting to feel like I'm going to be pregnant, and useless, forever." Camille shook her head. "Pay me no mind. I'm just feeling sorry for myself."

"I totally get the feeling-like-you're-going-to be-preggers-forever thing, but why on Earth do you feel useless|Sirona tried to quell her sense of disappointment. “What, then? Why did I see what I saw?”
“The young woman you observed being sacrificed,” her teacher asked, “Did she appear distraught, or did she go along with the ritual willingly?”
“I’m certain she was terrified,” said Sirona|I follow Logan to the back of the large room, where there’s a cot next to a few chairs. “Where are we?” I ask.
“Search and rescue coordination station.”
“That’s a mouthful.”
“Sit,” he says. When I go for one of the chairs, he snags my arm and swings me to the cot|Bob had forgotten to hide the shotgun and it still was loaded. He pulled over, waiting for the police to come to a stop behind him. But the police-it was Highway Patrol- zoomed past him. Bob was puzzled. Were they setting a trap for him? Did they know he was armed and dangerous and so were there a multitude of cars waiting for him ahead|There's a nice little spot where I can ask you all sorts of questions without being interrupted."

Dharr picked up the phone and spoke in a foreign language, then just as quickly hung up again. When he was done, he turned back to her expectantly. "How were your exams today?" he asked.

She was flattered that he remembered her telling him about her exams|"Jonah?" Stella crouches beside me. "Are you okay?"

I'm not okay. None of this okay. The fact that there are kids who have parents who can't afford shoes that fit or shoes at all, that's not okay. The fact that idiots like me make their life worse, that's not okay|To deviate Clare’s mind from thinking I don’t want to come inside the house, I ask her instead, “Do you know where Ivy is?”
“Why? You didn’t see her at school? I thought you two go to the same school?” She probes me with her own questions instead.
How do I reply to her? I only scratch my head. “We do, but I didn’t see her today|"No…" she gushed, "you would have done just fine. You're awesome at your job."
Peter's eyes narrowed. "I've got to get back into the kitchen, Emille," he said. "I just came out to remind you that you're responsible for lunch this weekend."
Emille looked across the table at Jeff, then back at Peter|They'd only been married for two months and still felt the sheer wonder of the intimacy they shared.

As soon as she saw him, Noelle raised her arms, seeking his attention.

"Come to Daddy," Mack urged, getting down on his knees a couple of feet from the coffee table.

Mary Jo held her breath and waited. Noelle glanced at her mother and then at Mack|Nine

They dined together back at Pine Lodge, then made love again that night, and when Samantha woke the next morning she lay there and wallowed in a sense of occasion. Her memories of them together like this were all she could take away with her. Her heart, she would leave with Blake.

He woke up then and made slow love to her again. Afterward she put on a bright face and they went about their business as usual, neither of them showing any outward sign to the others that they were lovers|“You look amazing…”

The school gym is all ready packed when we arrive. Everyone looks amazing and I can’t stop smiling as Chase leads me through the crowd on to the dance floor. I quickly scan the floor and see Ali dancing with Travis. I give her a quick wave, but tonight I am going to keep all my attention on Chase|Maybe he did like touching me during the dip, even though it didn't mean anything to him. That was cool. I could enjoy a football season of flirting with Drew and touching Drew. If I didn't die of heart palpitations.

Or heartbreak.

He set me up standing. "It was meant as a favor. Just take it as a favor and say, 'Thank you, Drew|Dogs can’t tell when you’re joking.”
She stared at him and another dog picked up its head.
“Can you tell when I’m joking, Mr. Sinclair?”
The third dog kept his head down, blinking between his mistress and her guest.
He said, “I thought you were always joking|He grinned down at her. "And then I was so turned on I had to keep my hands in front of me."

Now that would have made headlines. "I thought that was just because of the handcuffs."

"Oh, it was the handcuffs all right." He squeezed her hand in his, still holding the handcuffs|Lord Michael was impressed, the inn appeared comfortable, and probably made a very decent profit.  He rode his large bay gelding straight into the yard and the stables where the warhorse was taken by a human lad of about fifteen, who promised the Grand Knight that the horse would be given a good rub down before being fed.  With a pleased nod, and a final pat of his mount he left the stables|I'm going to go talk to George." Before she could start her protest, I reminded her, "You promised, so don't even think about starting a fight."

"I never promised."

"Did you tell me that you were mine?"

"Trevor, you know that I never agreed for you to talk to George|I pushed open the curtains to look outside and saw three things that took my breath away:

The first was the bottle of lube sitting on the windowsill.

The second was the enormous spiraling hedge maze in the rear garden.

The third was Mr. Stone standing at the entrance of the maze, looking up at me.

He tapped his watch and then stepped into the maze|First she called the housekeepers to have them check the dresser in her bedroom. They didn't find it. A couple of days later she called me to ask me to look in the safe. I didn't have the combination, but she gave it to me.”
“Did you find the earring?”
“No.”
“Just out of curiosity, what was in the safe|The Crowgard, Hawkgard, and Eaglegard kept watch on him all the way to Lakeside, then lost the car in traffic. We should figure that he's gone to ground here."

"Do we call that lieutenant?" Blair asked. "Can he hunt for Jones?"

"Doubtful," Vlad said. "Jones isn't an unusual name, and there are plenty of hotels, inns, and B and Bs in Lakeside|The fog - it had almost covered the helmet. She wiped it with her hand. Nothing. It was still there. She wiped again. Still there. Why wouldn't it go away? Of course - it was on the inside of the helmet. She knew that. Why did she even try to wipe the outside of the helmet|Amabilidad stated, “My brother will do nothing about Ayann's tales until she tells one of him that isn't to his liking and so far, all of her tales have my brother standing in a good light.”

"Oh, Rose..." Dee leaned forward and lowered her voice. "Are you sure?"

"Three test kits later," Rose said with a sigh, "I'm way sure."

A couple of minutes of silence passed before Dee sat back in her chair, keeping her gaze fixed on Rose|I've never really met anyone who asks the same straightforward questions I would, so I'm beginning to feel a little sympathetic to the people I put on the spot like this. I glance around the park until I see the makeshift wooden castle. I point to it. "You see the castle?"

She turns her head to look at the castle|And here come the first round of fireworks ...

Everyone in the hall quiets when Shane, still grinning like a peacock, drops to one knee in front of me. He takes the ring out of the box then reaches for my left hand before he clears his throat.

I'm sure he wants everyone to hear his proposal|Emma cuddled up into him under the awning as the camera flashed. The minister smiled before handing it back to Jack.

He grinned at the screen. The picture was perfect. It captured Emma's simple beauty and the two of them looked absolutely ecstatic. It looked like a real wedding picture.

"I better get a copy," Emma said, her eyes staying on the picture even as she handed the phone back to Jack|Kept at her until she came apart, screaming his name as her release tore through her, more powerful than the first. She couldn't breathe from the intensity of the pleasure, couldn't even form one coherent thought. When the shocks eased off, she was surprised she even survived it.

"That...that was amazing," she breathed unsteadily. "No, it was more than just amazing|I was the dominant figure in the cell, I got to sleep by the window, I was the one to blame.
I’d been lying on the floor, half asleep, when the door unlocked. We all have to sleep on the floor, with just a bit of straw for comfort. I don’t have a problem holding onto my bedding, but Florina would lose most of hers to the others in the cell|She sat down and looked up at him. "David, I'm going to give you a very useful piece of advice. If Michael Bennett or some other bully tries to take you out snipe hunting, you just tell them no, okay?"

"What's a snipe?"

She giggled. "There is no such thing as a snipe|One contained first aid supplies and fuel for Gregor to carry. Three larger packs of food were designed for the rats to haul. They had straps for the rodents' forelegs and a belt that fastened under their bellies. Nike was in charge of several heavy leather water bags.

Gregor surveyed the dense tangle of vines doubtfully. "How are you going to get along in there, Nike|Andy stood on the step stool at the sink to begin his sentence. He hated having to use it. Like so many other things in his life, the stool made him feel like a little kid. He squirted dishwashing liquid into the rising water, playing with the soap bubbles.
“Scrub every dish thoroughly and don’t make a mess, Andy|Fourth, a thicker chain secured the cage to the cart, making several loops, as if the weight of the cage wedged into the cart's hold wasn't enough to hold it in place. Ergo, he was captured by the slavers, and they were afraid that he would sprout wings and take off with the three-hundred-pound cage around him.

He couldn't remember how he got into the cage|Damian opens the door and they both slip inside, bringing with them the dirty smells of the diner. I try to hide my reaction and turn my attention back to driving as I steer the Lexus onto the road.
“Breakfast.” I jab one finger at the cooler resting in the passenger seat. 
“Oh, good.” Damian sounds eager, but he doesn’t make a move toward the cooler|“Once it’s finished, I’m out; right?” he stressed.
Ivadot nodded.
“So say it. Once I do what you ask, I’m out,” Tom demanded.
Ivadot paused for a moment, “Okay, you got my word.” Again, Ivadot paused as he stared at Tom|Grandpa Emilio grumbled and walked away.  “So, I’ll ask again, what do you want from me, lad?”   She really said that, lad, and it made me pause and I liked her even more. Let’s just say, I was intrigued. She didn’t’ say dude, she said lad|By no stretch of imagination did it feel cold or wintry in the least.

"She is an animal," Galen said, pushing back his chair. He took his empty bowl to the sink and began to run water into it, his back to us.

"Do not underestimate the demi-fey because of what they did to you, Galen|"Don't make me regret it, Claremont. I don't ever want Derek or Sofia to have a reason not to trust me."

"Thank you."

"Ingrid is asking to be brought to you..." He paused. "Actually, make that Camilla. She no longer wants to be called Ingrid|He wanted to fly me to New York City for dinner? Really? What did I say to this? I knew Sadie had done this kind of thing all the time last year while she was finishing up high school in Sea Breeze while Jax toured the states. But Jason and I had been on one date. This seemed kind of like a big deal for a second date|Seeing Sophia at Sebastian's house holding that little boy's hand, and hearing him call Sebastian 'daddy' was like a knife to my heart. Anything I thought I might be able to have with Sebastian was completely over. He had plenty of opportunities to tell me that he had a kid with Sophia but he didn't do it. I even asked him about her, about his relationship with her and he failed to mention the most important thing of all, his child|I think of him only as a friend. That's not fair to him. I must stop seeing him.

Mark had called the morning after the banquet. "Hello, Kelly. What would you like to do tonight?" Mark's voice was filled with anticipation. "Dinner and the theater? Or there are some stores open at night, and then there's-" "I'm sorry, Mark|Just seeing the bottle sent a shiver through Thea. The glass was so dark with age she couldn't tell what color it had been originally, and so misshapen it was hard to know if it was meant to be round or square. There was wax over the cork and all sorts of seals and ribbons.

Gran broke through the seals, pulled off the ribbons|Her boss gazed around the room and said, “It’s pretty slow tonight.  Do either of you want to go home early?”
Bryn perked up in excitement, but she decided to give Nicole a chance to claim it first.  “Do you want to go home?”
“I’d rather not,” admitted Nicole|Patrick's eyes widened. He tried to bend his fork, but couldn't. "Wow, you're really strong."

"I have superior strength, vision, and hearing. I can levitate, teleport, and control people's minds if I have to. You would be safe with me, Patrick|ANGELA

I first met him in a church. I had a thing for churches back then; I suppose I still do. They're so quiet most of the time, a quiet that's different from anyplace else, cool and peaceful and contemplative in their very nature. I'm not religious, not the way my mother is, but I like churches|"Ethan. Ethan Hale."

"Ethan." She tested it on her tongue. His name was familiar. It was as though she knew him somehow. "I'm Brianna. Brianna Cole."

"Brianna." He breathed her name softly.

"I'm not afraid of you, Ethan|I will be in the kitchen if he wakes up or needs me,” said his wife. 
As she played the sonata movement again, Carol whispered to Mathew: “Put the chocolates by his bed.  We can’t force him to eat them---but maybe he will if he wakes up and sees them there.”  
“I guess he’s finished writing this thing,” said Mathew|Lesley had the plastic plates and plastic silverware set out on the table, along with a large bag of potato chips, veggies and a cake she'd baked the night before.

Chase dug up the fish, scraped away the dried mud and peeled back the leaves. The tantalizing aroma of the trout took Lesley by surprise. Until then she hadn't thought she was hungry|"My lord, the guards are dying."  
"Gather the servants.  I'll need help."  Lord Odin waved at him.  With Alex's assistance, he made more of the potion as the servants arrived.
Alex administered the potion to two guards at the other end of the hall.  Then, she ran out the door, heading to the front gate with a bowl of potion|“She’s not handsome, she’s pretty, silly,” he said smiling and shaking his head as if it should have been obvious. 
For effect, Abby reached for her reading glasses and smiling said, “Oh my, I can’t believe I said she was handsome. She is very pretty. You’re right. I can’t see a thing without these glasses.”
 “Then why don’t you wear them if you’re blind|But before Holly could respond, I said joyfully,"I go to Trinity Di!"
Holly turned to her, an astonished look on her face.
"You do?" she asked.
"Uh-huh," said I. "What building are you in?"
"C," said Holly.
"A," said I.
"That's why we haven't ever seen each other," said Holly|He can at least escape execution."

Gregor nodded. That was about as much as he could hope for.

"Is there anything you would like to take back with you?" Vikus asked, gesturing to the shelves.

"I don't want anything but our stuff," said Gregor.

"If not for yourself, perhaps for your parents," said Vikus|It's as simple as that."

"I can't let you do that," she said, shaking her head.

"I'll tell you what," he said. "Throw in a poem and we've got a deal."

She looked at him blankly.

"At the end of the course, I want one of your poems|“Y’all hungry?”
“Hungry’s not a strong enough word,” I said.
“Well, there’s plenty here.” Owen opened a cabinet, pulled down three large soup bowls and handed one to Max and one to me. “Help yourself.”
“That’s what I call a bowl,” said Max|And after the games, we're off. It's the end of the term and I'll be graduating. There just wasn't time."
Lystus was lying. Melee practices hadn't crossed Alcander's mind. Lystus had talked incessantly about the impending competition and had insisted Alcander come by. And Alcander couldn't pass on the opportunity to participate in something that was important to Lystus|“Aye, they do at that.”
A ninja, screaming and on fire, came running through the front end of the Gordo’s.  Duke coughed and waved his hand back and forth in front of him to dispel the smoke trail.
“Uh,” said the Captain.
“He’s been on fire since Season One,” said Duke|This is serious business, and we need to think things through."

Sera didn't want a long argument. She knew Dak had a point about the clothes, but figured saying so wasn't the way to get Riq on board. "You're probably right," she said. "Maybe we shouldn't worry about the clothes|I take a step towards her, getting in her space.

"I am not going to change my mind," I growl the words, making her eyes widen slightly.

Then she takes a breath. "Well, then call when you're ready," she says quietly before squatting down to Jax's level.

"It was very nice to meet you, Jax|"Yes, it is holding," said Helen.  "We'll give the poison time to get into the root beer, if it's going to."
Helen placed her basket on the grass again.  The black root beer bubbled merrily in the basket.
"Is that enough time?" asked Stephanie.
"Yeah, I guess so," said Helen|His love's beautiful face flashed before him and at Glass's words, it shimmered, changing to the face of his love's daughter.

He shook himself, glancing at Glass who stared out into the water. "I'm surprised. After I gave Charlie that emerald, I expected her to be angry with me."

Glass shrugged. Red had noticed Glass had taken to dressing in mortal clothing-jeans and T-shirts-and he did not need to wonder at the change|Whatever was on the other side of the grate pushed full force, and I almost lost hold with my one hand, still holding the hatpin. Then it was cut too.
I switched hands, trying to keep the vent from coming free and prevent another laceration.
What was back there?  I pulled my feet up and pressed them against the grate|Joey had given his contact details as ‘Merringe & Sons Land and Chartered Engineering Surveyors’ with a London phone number.  Helford rang and enquired if they could help him with information on their employee.  He was told that Joey had been employed for only a three-month contract, and had failed to complete this.  He had vanished just two days before the end of his contract|exclaimed Dad, “over there, behind that lander.”
“Cool!” cried Joseph, as he went bounding across the moon-scape to investigate.
“The batteries must be dead,” observed Dad, as Joseph sat in the rover and tried the controls, without success.
“It would have been so fun to go speeding across the moon-scape,” bemoaned Joseph|Suddenly, an urgent voice rose up from the courtyard below, calling out “Mr. Rios, Mr. Rios.” Rios got up abruptly from the conference table and rushed to the window. Jose Ramirez was standing below, his hands cupped to his mouth. “Fire’s coming from the canyon,” he shouted up at Rios. “It’s half way to the barn already|The door to the inner suite was partly ajar and Janet could see the silhouette of a woman’s figure against the light of the window. She rapped softly on the door which opened somewhat further to reveal Doris Lindsay packing books and other assorted objects from the wall shelves into a number of cardboard boxes.
"Oh, pardon me," said Janet|There was a partition between us that I assumed was for privacy, but I didn’t need any and the car was so big, I felt lonely in the back all alone. I tapped on the window and Jeffrey lowered it a few inches. 

“Did you need something, Miss?”

“It’s just lonely back here, Jeffrey|Then Jay felt a tingling heat on his hand and he pulled his flaming limb to his sight. IT WAS ON FIRE!
“Oh, my, GOD! Ah!” Jay squealed, trying to shake the flame off his hand.
“Oh shut up. It doesn’t really hurt. It’d hurt me, but not you. I’m Jordan by the way, if you’d forgotten,” Jordan said with a smile, before jumping out from behind the transparent shield and running away from Jay|"And you just have to go wherever they tell you to?"

"If I want to play ball, I do," I responded with a playful grin, hoping to lighten the darkening mood.

Gran's concerned gaze swung between Cassie's face and mine. "What will you two do when he leaves?"

"Well, we haven't really talked about it yet, Gran|Three of them pulled the Mainlander away from the curtain and pinned him to the wall. The others disappeared into the ceiling.
Only Thomas remained, basking in the sunlight and grinning. He drew the curtain across and the others hesitantly returned.
“What shall we do with the human, sire?” asked Adonis.
“I’ve a few ideas,” said Thomas|The light of the fire glinted off his leather boots and shadows danced across the starched creases of his uniform making him appear ten feet tall.  “You can leave your science project by the door,” he said casually.  “I trust it won’t blow us up until after the Fuhrer has finished with the children.  Come.  Have a drink with me.”  Henrik saluted automatically.  Heydrich returned the salute and then filled a second goblet with brandy and handed it to Henrik|And they can't ever come back."

"Gallagher Girl," Zach started, but I cut him off with a nod.

"Them." The word was a whisper. "He said find them. That's why it isn't safe for me to stay." I reached up and gripped his shirt, made him face me as I said, "Think about it, Zach|There’s nothing we can do about it now.”
My cell phone broke off my annoyed retort. We couldn’t give up. It was Anne from the Palos Video Store, “What’s up?” 
I listened. Oh no. I completely forgot about my shift at the store. “I’ll be there in twenty minutes, Anne|Whatever deal you had with her mother is with her mother. Pagan had nothing to do with this."

"You'd of nevah known her if I hadn't healed her. You'd of taken her soul whilt she lay curled up dying as a child. It's me who don lak to see chilren die|"Well, I doubt the Keres are the same as you are thinking"

And as we continued the drive into the city, I continued to explain everything that I knew so far, including how Hephaestus was chained to the door in Zeus' palace. We were pulling into the city limits by the time I wrapped it up and the look on Jade's face was tantamount to hysteria.

"Calm yourself," I cautioned. "We can't accomplish anything if we are hysterical|He was in her past and she was eternally thankful for that.

"Tell me about your receptionist job?" he asked, leaning against her desk as if he had all the time in the world.

Lana took a deep breath, disgusted with him and refusing to be intimidated. "Drew, you ask that question as if there was something wrong with being a receptionist|Four, is it?"

His gaze flickered away. "You were listening."

"No, no. I did catch a little of your conversation, though." She shouldered him to the side and leaned over to toss her clothes in the dryer. "Your mom is..."

"Relentless," he supplied with a laugh, crossing his arms as he leaned on the granite folding counter next to the dryer|"The dates of disappearances are fairly random..."
Teria continued on with her theories as Gaent studied the list. "We have two groups," he concluded. "Students and older laborers."
Teria blinked and came around the desk to read over Gaent's shoulder. "I suppose so."
"Targets and donors," said Gaent.
"Alcander must have been a target," said Teria|Leah smiled as she turned away briefly, too. When she looked back toward them, she said, "This is my boyfriend, Declan. Declan, these two lovely people are Millie and William Taylor. They've been residents here for almost a year."

"It's lovely to meet you, Declan|"Don't think you can leave me out of the loop."

"We appreciate your help," Roman told him. "We'll let you know our final decision."

Sean snorted, then glanced at Gregori. "I'll talk to you tonight after sunset." He strode from the room.

Gregori watched the door shut, then turned back to face Roman|"Get used to hearing that. It's his favorite line."

Then you must want to punch him a lot, I thought before Zach's pointedly arched brow reminded me that my musings weren't private. That might not be all bad, though. I seized my chance.

Tell me what Adrian is, and why he's so determined to get away from me once this is over, I thought, staring at Zach|“Christy Wayne,” an asset-heavy blonde girl in a stretched tight shirt who was not at all shy about her particular gifts. 
“And Ignacio Anderson,” a pale, skinny girl with very large, tawny-colored eyes. 
Monson smiled and nodded at each girl. Their reactions to his appearance confused him. They looked disgusted, that much was sure, but also intrigued|You might get pus on it, and you're borrowing it from me."
Mallory's eyebrows began to clench up in anger, but they relaxed and she started laughing. Stephanie joined her, and soon they had the whole room giggling.
"You... are .... so .. evil!" snorted Mallory through her laughs.
"You better believe it," said Stephanie|“Not now,” I cautioned in a whisper, gulping down the rest of my panic. I glanced around the school grounds swarming with students. “Not here.”
“Oooohhh! It’s a big, friggin’ secret.” Hugo rubbed his hands together. “Can’t wait.”
“You’ll never believe it, Hugo|It made the most sense. Maddy frowned. It didn’t seem right.
Maddy looked further into the yard and spotted Riley. A sea of overgrown weeds billowed around him and a few sunflowers bowed above his tall frame, his muscular shoulders relaxed against his button up shirt.
Grace linked arms with Maddy, a familiar gesture she’d done since they were kids, and pulled Maddy to catch up with Riley|She was a great deal more interested in making sure that she kept her balance and that the edges of the shoes didn't come down at too sharp an angle, tearing the croach and revealing their presence to foes who were, in all likelihood, too numerous to fight successfully in any case.

Amara took one step, then another. No whistling, warbling outcry went up around her. She paused to look back as Bernard stepped onto the croach|“But you finally were with your crush.  Think of that and be happy.  Finally you hooked up with your crush.”
“That’s why she needs her weed,” said Stacie drolly.
“All my weed is gone.  I think somebody jacked it,” said Tiffany.
“You like smoked it, stupid,” said Stacie|"Dad says he's going back to work, but his fevers have started coming back in the afternoons, so I don't think he can," said Lizzie.

"He's sick again?" asked Gregor.

"I read the paper they sent that time from the Underland. It said people can have re-lap-ses. The dictionary says that means it comes back again," said Lizzie|“I’d be happy to. I’ll need to be cosigner on your checking account if I’m going to do that, however.”
“I know. Let’s make arrangements for that with Paul.” Paul waited outside, seated in a chair. Adam poked his head around the corner of the doorway and said, “You didn’t really have to wait out here, Paul|At that moment, they heard a deep, rumbling sound, an unearthly cry that arose from somewhere in the forest below them. After a moment, the cry was answered, from another part of the forest.

Diego's eyes widened.

Levine mouthed: Birds?

Diego was silent. He bit his lip, and stared out at the forest|“I assumed it would be tough for you here,” Micah said, leaning back. “It had to be. I wanted to help you, but I knew you wouldn’t accept cash. You’re stubborn that way.”
She huffed. “I’m not stubborn.”
“Believe me,” he said without smiling. “If there’s one thing you are, Katja, it’s stubborn|He told me not to mention the audit to anyone.” 
“I see,” Sam said. Then, more softly, she said, “There’s one more thing.”
“Yes?”
 “Your father’s body has been taken to the Medical Examiner’s Office,” Sam said. “Someone from the family will need to make the identification|“Yessir,” the teller responded in decent English. The teller pulled a bill from the middle of the stack and examined it, drawing a marking pen across the bill, just as Bob was accustomed to seeing it done at almost every cash register back in the US. Bob started getting nervous as the teller continued to examine the bill|Abby planted her feet but her shoes skidded across the stone as he pulled.

He stopped, spinning around to look at her and clipped, "Abby!"

"Cash, no," she cut him off as the others came dashing out of the house to surround them, "we have to go to the gallery."

Cash ignored their audience and bit out, "We're not going to the f**king gallery|The prison where he was being kept was melted down until it looked just like the metal you're standing on."
Seven scuffed her padded shoes on the lump of copper metal she'd just stepped on. She looked up and noticed a ship had come down at the tower.
"Crystal, I think someone's here to talk." She said. She jumped down and ran back to the tower|Simply stated, it means that no one individual is greater than any other. One of my instructors at the Academy gave me that meaning.”
“The other meaning, which I find more applicable when I think of Eza, was explained to me by the dean of the school. No One Is Greater didn’t simply mean that you must be humble|She told him how weird the whole situation seemed to be since Ben did not drink yet he had been found drunk at the scene of the accident.
Derek noted everything Michelle said and then checked in with the police who had investigated the accident.  They confirmed Michelle’s story that Ben had been drunk.
“It was just another drunk driver hitting a telephone pole,” the investigating officer explained.
“I’m not so sure,” replied Derek|“Because there’s wolves in the tree-line” he whispered
Wesson wasn’t sure he’d heard the man correctly so he went for a clarification.
“Wolves?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Real wolves? Like the ones in the national forests?”
The man started to laugh and Wesson felt relieved for he really had thought the man said wolves|From the outside it could be just another joyous family reunion. We don't speak of anything that happened until Mom asks for help in the kitchen, and Sam and Matthew follow her. Dad, Uncle Dylan, and I are left alone standing next to the smoking grill. We just stand there for a long time, silently watching the smoke rise out of the grill|As if Pepsi had understood the difference between big and fat, the cat eased down off the arm and tentatively approached Chad. She held her breath.

Chad reached out and scratched the cat behind his ear. "What's his name?"

"Pepsi."

"Pepsi?" Chad laughed. "Why that name?"

She smiled. "I found him in a Pepsi case when he was a kitten|It was discouraging, to say the least.  Then, Joel grabbed Roke’s sleeve and held a finger to his ear. 
“Now what?” said his big friend. “You’re holding us up.”
“What’s that sound?” asked Joel.
“It’s the wind,” said Roke|She'd been so strong to cope with Liam and his illness, plus her father's stroke and dementia. And she'd shouldered it all alone and without complaint. He could understand why she'd pushed Liam to go home to die those last few months. She'd needed the break. And now she'd taken on her sister's problems|I consider for a second; I would like time alone—but what if Victoria gets it in her head to go hunting Aaron?  But, she’ll probably leave when Dr Flynne gets here anyway.
“Will you promise me something?” I ask her.
She nods.
“Do you promise that you won’t go looking for Aaron|"I am, Mom, I am."

"Then that's all I can ask."

Maryellen smiled and leaned over to clasp her mother's hand. "Thanks, Mom-I needed to hear that. Now, how about some of that pasta casserole over there? I suddenly feel hungry."

Almost a week later, on Friday afternoon, Grace was still thinking about her conversation with Maryellen|“I have all faith your ego will survive.” Lady Southridge shook her head.
He glared at her.
“Shall we?” Carlotta stood and walked towards the vicar who had been watching the exchange with avid interest and found it amusing enough to grin slightly.
At least she thought it was a grin.
It might have been annoyance but she chose to believe it was a grin|As acceleration pushed them into the seats, a holomap came on, showing Nightingale receding into the spectacular bones of the Giant's Skeleton Mountains. The peaks withdrew until they were no more than wrinkles in the vast panorama of the world.

Gradually Jato's mind absorbed the situation. He was free. Free.

Or at least, he thought he was free|She was a pickpocket, with a father who beat her when she didn't steal and ruffian friends to deal with those who tried to catch her. Sinclair faced women like her in the dock all the time. Most were driven to thieving and prostitution-they didn't know any other way, couldn't even imagine it. Bertie wasn't a game girl, but she was a thief|Once you're there, you should know what to do next."

His plan took form in my mind and I nodded, as I then fully grasped what he was attempting to do. "I understand. And Sofia Claremont?"

He finally let go of my hair. "We will end her."

With that, his presence swept out of the room like a powerful, foreboding wind; exactly the same way he arrived|A stout man with a completely pale face and a top hat held out his hand to Levi. He took off his hat before bowing awkwardly.

"Hello, may I get your name?"

"Oh yes, Harold Mayer. I am the new representative of the Bleths."

"Well, nice to meet you, Harold|What if Melissa was the killer and tried to hurt them?

Ali was already at the door. "Strength in numbers," she insisted. "C'mon. We have to end this craziness right now."

Ali marched into the hall, made a left, and knocked on Melissa's bedroom door. No answer. She leaned against it lightly, and it swung open with a long creak|Gary heard the other man’s fly unzip, listened to him breathe out a heavy sigh. In his peripheral vision, he noticed him shrug his shoulders and roll his neck, then sniff sharply and clear his throat.
“First time in LAX?” asked the man, after spitting into the urinal.
“Nah, I fly through here a couple times a year on the Mach 15 Express,” said Gary|To protect me the way he couldn't -" Lizzie cut herself off.

"The way he couldn't protect Silksharp," Gregor finished for her.

"How did you know about her?" asked Lizzie.

"Heard you guys talking one night," said Gregor.

"It was my fault he died, Gregor," said Lizzie|Violet moved slowly across the floor to the foot of the cardboard box and squatted down by the opening. As the new flames licked up out of the drum, she saw Matthew in the lowlight sprawled under sheets of old newspaper, lying on his back, his eyes open, blinking slowly-glassy from the wine.

"How do you live like this, Matthew|The dewan ought to have been handsome with his dark hair and deep-set eyes, but his mouth was a little too full, the cleft in his chin a little too pronounced, and his mustache and muttonchops excessively aggressive. This facial hair had initially given Alexia much distress. Why? was the question. Most gentlemen went clean-shaven into immortality's long night. Poor Biffy had had to wait in scruffy purgatory until Alexia returned home from her European tour and turned him mortal long enough to shave|Drumming her fingers against the desk, Mara grinned and said, "I might."

Half an hour later, Annabelle and Mara were climbing the bleachers behind the high school, a brown bag of wine coolers in hand. "I know where we are," Annabelle said. "But I'd like to know why we're here."

Mara pulled two coolers out of the bag and after opening the first one, she handed the bottle to Annabelle|Cain gave him an odd look, but slid from the bed, putting his body between Madoc and Sibyl as he led her from the room. He was weaving on his feet, barely able to stay standing but that was just too f**king bad. He deserved whatever he got for doing this to Nika.

The door shut behind them with a click, leaving him alone in the room with Nika|Well, at least partially."

I see one dark brow arch. His voice is droll when he says, "Partially, huh?"

"Yes, partially. I think that I do view many people in my life as weak because of their weakness. And although I can appreciate that you do have some ... issues to work through, I can honestly say that I've never once considered you or thought of you as weak|I want to go to him, hug him and make it better, but my feet won't move.

"Mom was exhausted and I was laughing with you. She almost fell asleep and went off the road. They could have died or been hurt and I was making love to you. I should have been there. If I had been there, I would have been driving|It lent a golden glow to Bonnie's pale face as she bent over it.

"I'm going to need both of you to help me focus," she said. "Look into the flame, and think about Stefan. Picture him in your mind. No matter what happens, keep on looking at the flame|I asked you if I wasn’t engaged, would you kiss me?  All you said was that I was engaged so it was pointless to answer the question.  Now I’m not engaged.  So...” She took a step closer to him so that they were almost touching.  “Would you have kissed me that day if I hadn’t been engaged|A large crowd of people dressed in tuxedos and evening gowns milled around sipping beverages.
Gary heard the music, felt its beat course through his veins.  He felt his body begin to move in time with the rhythm.
“Not yet, Gary,” Diana chastised under her breath.  “What are you doing?”
“I – I can’t help it,” said Gary|BEN HATED SLEEPING ON a friend's couch. He hated feeling like a loser who couldn't hold a job or make a go at any career he started. And he absolutely hated having to ask his brother for money.

"I just know I can make this gym thing work," he muttered. But Roper didn't want to talk about money|I got into it with my dad after the game and then when I saw Jonah grab you..."

Hardy was wearing his heart on his sleeve and his regret on his face. Miracle searched the blue gray of his eyes for...something. He hoped she would find it.

With a sigh, Miracle glanced down at the still-unconscious Jonah|“I’m a famed inspector, if that is true, because I solve cases.”
“Then solve this one,” she said, her voice oddly pleading. “For Heather.”
“You are not concerned with the dead, Miss Bingley?”
She answered without hesitation, “I am more concerned about the living|Snow frosted her fiery hair; her gold eyes reflected his flashlight. She wore a long gray coat over dark clothes.

"I'm sorry I'm late, Ivar," she said. She tossed her hair, scattering snow like some ancient goddess of winter.

Though only in her late twenties, Krista Magnussen had become the chief geneticist for his corporation's Crop Biogenics division|When they turned, Sarah nodded in her brother's direction. "There's someone I'd like you to meet." When Jonah stood up from the dirt, Sarah saw that the knees of his pants were circled with brown. He and Miles met them halfway.

"This is my brother, Brian. And Brian, this is Miles and his son, Jonah|One minute I was reading to a blank face with eyes closed. The next minute I looked up and his eyes were open and one arm was propped up in front of his face. His pointer finger was moving slowly up and down. He was staring at it. 
 “You’re awake.” I stammered.
His head turned slightly, he smiled, and then turned back to his finger|Theo interrupted her panicked thoughts. "You're looking kind of flushed. He gets heavy, I know."

"Oh, right, sure." Grace passed Dash over, and took possession of the empty stroller in return. Theo settled the baby easily on one hip.

"Time to stop wearing Auntie Grace out," he told Dash|An Imperial Affliction was my book, in the way my body was my body and my thoughts were my thoughts.

Even so, I told Augustus. "My favorite book is probably An Imperial Affliction," I said.

"Does it feature zombies?" he asked.

"No," I said.

"Stormtroopers?"

I shook my head. "It's not that kind of book|“Uh, no reason,” said Blake, putting his briefcase down on the couch.  “It just seems like you’re a bit … tense, or something.”
Trudy’s smile broadened, as she absently picked a flower out of a vase by the door, and crushed it mercilessly.  “What makes you think I’m tense|She didn't need to. There was a steely coolness in her voice that told Rafe she was not the kind of woman you could trifle with.

Realizing he'd made a mess of things he decided to try a different tactic. "Forget what I just said. That didn't come out quite the way I intended|Back when the Maze was fully operational, holotech had been used to conceal it, to make it look like part of the fake, endless sky beyond the stone edge of the drop-off. It was all turned off now, of course, and Thomas could see the walls of the Maze through the opening. A stepladder had been placed directly under it.

"I can't believe we're back here," Teresa said, moving to stand beside Thomas|Josh was sitting back at Bob's favorite table sipping tea.  
Bob started raising Cain and Josh returned the complements until they made contact.  Then swings caught in the air and wrestling started until the waitress brought out an iron skillet from the kitchen and threatened both of them.  
I'd never seen Josh bow to a woman before, but he bowed to the waitress and asked her, “Can I be of assistance against this ruffian,” pointing over his shoulder at Bob|I made a quick decision and swung around again to pursue the purple car. My U-turn wasn’t quite as perfect this time.
Cora Mae screamed as we headed for the ditch.

“There’s a piece of barbed wire stuck on your front bumper,” Little Donny said when I pulled into the drive. He was headed to the shed with George, but he stopped and removed the wire|Ana paused for a moment, and debated whether she should stop right there. She could handle a shot of vodka alone, she supposed, but this drink contained a few shots of other liquors. She was drinking close to a bottle of vodka a day before, so she calculated that this cocktail couldn’t harm her. She would stop as soon as she felt a buzz|Her face bore an expression of compassion. "He didn't want to do it, Victoria. He did not want to. He would have done anything but that. Eustacia ordered him to do it."

Her eyes dampened. "What? How could she?"

"She did what had to be done, Victoria|"In a manner of speaking," Deryn replied. "Mom, something cut his femoral artery and he was bleeding to death. Someone found him, mom. Somebody who knew he was dying and that the emergency crews wouldn't be able to save him, even with a doctor standing over him. The one who found him was a vampire, mom|That one word was made of one syllable and three simple sounds.  The word was “will.”

It reminded me of the last time someone had given me a blessing.  It was when I was leaving Professor D’Verbose’s office.  On the way out he said, “His will be done.”  I thought it was an archaic way to give a blessing|Somebody you - liked, and wanted to see again. Would there be any kind of a spell for that?"

Laurel's brown eyes sparkled again. "Now, is this a boy-type person we're supposing about here?" she said.

"Yes." Cassie knew she was blushing again.

"Well - " Laurel glanced at Melanie, who was shaking her head in a resigned way, then turned back to Cassie|The bed was perfectly made, without a wrinkle in the sheet. Carlos wondered if Tom even slept in beds anymore. Did he just curl up on the ground? Did he use a hammock or sleeping bag or create a bed out of heather and old grass?
Tom was at the window, his hands behind his back, looking out across the garden|Gregor started to back out of the room.

"No, wait, Overlander," Nerissa said in a tremulous voice. "Stay a moment."

"Oh, okay, sure," Gregor said, wishing very badly he could get out of there. "So, how've you been, Nerissa|Silent as always, as always speaking his wordless language, replacing words with acts. So it had been for as long as she could remember. In fact, she and the bear had never spoken, the bear had always only acted his meaning. Other than that, he had no meaning to communicate. Her shadow, her guardian bear. She smiled to herself at that, and apparently, so did the bear|"I understand that, but-"

"We're cruising up from Jacksonville to Norfolk. We can drop you off first thing in the morning."

"I need to be there an hour ago."

"You have a badge?"

"My badge number is six-zero-nine-two. I don't have the luxury-"

"You don't have a badge|I cast a look at Christian and Kay over my shoulder. Predictably, Kay is crying. She's clinging to Christian's shoulders and sobbing.

Tucker turns to follow my gaze.

Christian leans closer to Kay and whispers something. Whatever it is, she does not take it well. She starts crying even harder.

"Man, you couldn't pay me to be in his shoes right now," says Tucker|"What a boor," she exclaimed, her fingers crumpling the sides of the paper.

"What's wrong, dear?" Natasha said, dropping her pen and looking at her angry daughter. She was immediately concerned since she'd seemed so happy a moment before.

"That man!' she said, turning the paper and pointing to the article|She sat quietly with her eyes closed inside the hexagonal prison. Her dress had been replaced with another white dress, this time of Auroran cut. Despite being a prisoner, the Einhart tried to give her the respect that was befitting of a royal, regardless of the world she came from. She would want for nothing, other than freedom|"The minute we walked into the castle, the entry swayed. You were there, you said you felt it!"

"That wasn't a ghost," he said.

"Then what was it?" Abby queried.

His face now held a hint of soft concern. "I don't know, darling, but it wasn't a f**king ghost|I don't know what woman can make him settle down, but I'd love to meet her."

Daniel brightened, prone to lightning changes of moods. "Settle down like you did, Uncle Mac?"

"Mind your tongue, boy."

"Leave him be." Isabella signaled to Bellamy, who approached with more coffee. "You're perfectly welcome to stay with me, Daniel|"I have a private booth booked in the bar. Mr. Stone."

She smiles. "Ah, of course, Mr. Stone. And a...Ms. Lopez?"

"That's correct. Can you send her through when she arrives?"

"Of course. If you follow Neil here, he'll take you to your booth|Taking a deep breath, he rubbed his hair out of his face, and tilted his head, "What should I say? That you're right? That your pain can't give me what I need because I'm not the one who caused it? Ivy, I don't want to leave you right now. You seem... fragile."

I smirked, "Compared to you, I'm always fragile|"I don't believe he knew she carried his child."

"I'm sorry ye lost your son." Ilysa could not yet think of the young man in the story as her father. "Do ye want his brooch back? Is that why ye came to tell me this?"

"I didn't come for the brooch|Darius and Porus had these, and we defeated them. Are they afraid of unknown lands and difficult terrain? We have campaigned in many strange countries and crossed mountains, deserts, and rivers. Are they now shivering women, cowards who would not follow their King?"
"No, Sire, they are not cowards|He made his way into the bright sun and looked above. The noise seemed to be coming from the sun itself. He shaded his eyes with his hand and looked around. Louder and louder, the sound came. He saw a black speck appear in the sky. It got bigger with each passing second. He loved Vietnam movies and he knew that sound|I don’t want to die by falling out of a tree!” 
“You’re not going to fall.” Mark said patiently. “Emma, this is important. I need to go help Jason but I can’t do that if you won’t let go.” 
Emma’s grip loosened a little bit at the mention of Jason|When it was time for all girl peeps to leave Moma Vill and go breed, they sent me to Bed Vill. I felt like a loser.”
Savi is silent, just thinking I guess, so I let her. She’s got more to say, I know.
“It no bother me that I don’t get to breed|“Well, in case you’ve forgotten, G, I’m leaving, remember?”
	“Oh.” Gina muttered and paused, “Speaking of that…if you arrive in Tuscany, what’d happen between you and that chatmate of yours?”
	“He has a name, it’s Martin.” Serena answered, “And again, just in case you’ve forgotten, it’s partly because of him that I can get to go to Tuscany|‘Oh, I’m forgetting my manners. I’m Charles Corriedale, trumpet player with the Oswestry Sheep Orchestra,’ Charles said, extending a hoof.
‘Aiden Peersey,’ Aiden said, swapping the phone to his other hand and shaking the extended hoof.
‘Have you ever seen the OSO play|It s andnice.

Was I missing something?

She frowned, disappointed.

It s nice? That s all you have to say?

It s a candle.

I shrugged.

What do you want me to say?

She bit at her lip, biting back a smile.

No, it s so much more than a candle|Chapter Forty-one

The massive hotel stretched from city block to city block, surrounded by a low, medieval-style brick wall.

An array of lights lit the hotel, and the building's sheer complexity of style was enough to nearly overwhelm the senses, everything from Spanish Gothic, Mission Revival, Moorish Revival, Renaissance Revival and Mediterranean Revival. I know something about architecture. If I hadn't been an investigator, I would have been an architect|Chris managed an embarrassed shrug, before he said - “Okay.”

“Not much of a theatre goer, huh?” Tom guessed, with a smile. “No matter; if you don’t like it, you can always put it down to a bad experience.” 

“I‘m sure it can‘t be all that bad,” Chris drawled, wondering  to himself why Tom was even asking him to show up at the theatre|The shaggy man thought they would taste better than the oat-straw, so he walked over to get some. A little black dog with bright brown eyes dashed out of the farm-house and ran madly toward the shaggy man, who had already picked up three apples and put them in one of the big wide pockets of his shaggy coat. The little dog barked and made a dive for the shaggy man’s leg; but he grabbed the dog by the neck and put it in his big pocket along with the apples|‘Well, gentlemen, it seems as though our victim did indeed die as a result of blunt force trauma, a single blow to the back of the head. TOD is, as I thought initially, sometime on Friday evening, probably between 7.30 and 9.30.’
‘Any idea about what was used?’ asked Jenkins.
‘We found a splinter of wood in the wound.  I’ll have it analysed to see what sort of wood|There was everything from a Thai chicken and curry dish, to traditional Indian naan bread, and lasagna. To top if off, he’d grabbed some double chocolate chip cookies that were the size of plates and two chocolate hazelnut tortes.
“I’m tempted to skip the food and go right for the cookies.” She stabbed the lettuce in her salad, but her eyes never left the cookies|“Yeah,” I agreed, nodding. “It is wonderful.” Another glance at Paul found him examining the desert menu. “I mean, I know it’s old fashioned,” I added, “but I love that Paul is and always will be the only one.”
“Hmm,” he hummed in reply, his eyes still staring at the menu|We had hot weather and we had to worry about the radiation from the atomic blasts. Now we are on a strange planet 40 light years from Earth and we have radiation and heat. But we have to explore. That is why we were sent. 
We start walking around. 475 (Linguist 2) will take photographs with our military cameras. I hope the film is not affected by the radiation|Silently, I reached down and brought Bo's fingers to my lips. His hands were so strong, so capable, but I knew that there were some things in life that even Bo couldn't fix.

********

The next morning, Bo was already gone when my alarm went off. I hadn't even been aware of him leaving|She should tell him...everything. But something stopped her. Fear, remorse, shame, the knowledge that this had to end one way or another so why make admissions that would only haunt her and hurt him?

"Everything needs to be mutual," he said. "Whatever people do together, it has to be mutual|The wound was a medium sized puncture, and the skin around it was black and blue with a tint of green. The spike looked like a rose thorn, only larger and silver.
"It hit me," she whispered softly. Stephanie nodded, unable to keep the guilt out of her face.
"We saw it coming and were able to leap out of the way," said Stephanie|“Keira, this ring is yours, to be worn on your hand as a reminder of the love I have for you. There is nothing in this world that would match the value you have for me. Compared to you, this is a mere trinket.” As he spoke, Aaron pulled her hand into his own, and slid the ring onto her finger. Keira twisted her hand, letting the sunlight catch the gem, then looked at Aaron|She had no idea where it was parked.  She hid the body in the bushes, then walked to the front of the hotel and found the valet’s hut.
“Hi, I need my car, please,” she said, faking tears.  “I have to go – go home.”
“Oh, yes, ma’am,” said the valet|"You said you found my ring?"

I pulled the plastic bag with the ring in it out of my bag and showed it to her.

Vivian's whole face lit up at the sight of the ring, like it was the most important thing in the world to her. Maybe it was, given the attachment she had to it|"He left them here?" Reacher asked.

She touched the shoulder of one of the suits through the plastic.

"I figured he'd come back for them," she said. "But he didn't, the whole year. I guess he didn't need them."

"He must have had a lot of suits|Near the cathedral d'Angelay said something to the driver and we turned down a little side street. The doctor pointed ahead.
“L'Epicerie Herve,” he said.
I saw the sign above the door and an instant later I saw a girl standing in the doorway.
It was Giselle.
The ambulance slowed down and stopped. I opened the door, put my head out and said softly, “Giselle|This produced a frenzy of shouts, “The Elk.... welcome to the Elk... they are on the way!” And people jumped up and down, everyone taking part, trying to stay in unison. “The Elk! Elk! Elk!” Chaiko also joined in though it wasn’t easy with his one good leg.
Eventually people dropped out exhausted and collapsed onto the grass, still yelling, “Elk|Gaent didn't answer. He was carefully scanning the surface of the bench.
"Most likely," said Teria.
Leo nodded. "I've just recently learned that one," he said, proudly. He did have a lovely smile, Teria noted before continuing her sketch.
Gaent found nothing on the surface of the bench|"Why is that, Mrs. Goodwin?" inquired Vivian, kindly.
Bess endeavored to explain. "When my mother was a mite, she was bitten on the nose by a malicious pigeon."
"I have nightmares about it 'til this very day," confessed the cook.
"How, pray tell, did your nose venture that close to a pigeon|He was the one who called the shots down here. My life depended upon his decision. But that would be the worst time to get cold feet. There was no going back.
We got into a kind of shuttle bus, at least that was what it felt like. Then we walked again and I felt like we were raised as if we’d been in a huge elevator|It was safer to proceed as vapor, not touching the walls or ground where they might trigger a trap. That worked until they turned a corner and encountered a giant spider web. The strands of the web were closely woven. It was impossible for even vapor to slip through without disturbing the silky threads. A very small spider sat in the corner of the web.

The hunters shifted into Carpathian form to study the design of the thick web|Adam strode in through the gates and I hurried after him, ignoring the curious gazes of my fellow students, and the excited chatter as they guessed that the clearly older Adam was here on my behalf and something was about to go down.

My cheeks burned with embarrassment, while my heart pounded in anticipation for a little retribution for the worst morning in the history of my entire school career.

When we rounded the corner of the building, Adam stopped and stared into a crowd of seniors. The fourth and fifth years gradually turned their heads towards us, their eyes widening at the sight of me with Adam|"Yes, I do."
The laughter stopped.
"What makes you think he is a troll?" Sha Yukima asked.
"Well, look at the size of him," Nasinwa said.
Yukima nodded. "I've never seen a troll that big. Have you? But I have seen many men the size of trolls|But it used to be, apparently, when the planet was.”

Qyro lifted an eyebrow. “How’d you know?”

“Because that’s where the tablet is.” Ion recalled the exact directions to the tablet, as Mantra had told him. “This abandoned city is where we’re going to find the tablet|While Jay and Mike stared at the hostess with appreciative eyes, Khalil pushed through the small crowd and made his way to the podium. “Hi, Latif, party of seven. How long is the wait?”
The hostess looked at him for a moment as though baffled by the question. “Err, do you have a reservation|Not a gentle What's the matter, dear Hayden? but a sharp What's up? like a boy growing impatient while bowling a girl over.

"Uh, I don't know," I stammered. "I just don't get a good vibe about this."

"You don't get a good vibe|"So Claire," she said as she stood there clasping her hands in front of her, wondering how best to broach the subject, "uhm, how are things working out in your classroom? I haven't seen your assistant today. How's he managing with the babies?"

Claire looked up from her papers and her face broke into a warm smile. "Everything's going splendidly," she gushed. "I couldn't have asked for a better assistant|Only when Lucy looks up does the teacher's attention move to her, and Lucy can tell she's called a name whose owner was a mystery to her.

"I have a slip here telling me to send you to the counselor's office?" She phrases it like a question, and it feels like she's asking Lucy to confirm. She stands, painfully aware of the attention of the entire class, and takes the slip|I know he never cared about you growing up, I know he never gave you any time, and I know he was wrong about that. But ask yourself: wouldn’t what you do now fit in just fine with how he practices politics?"
She looked away. She remembered taking a job for her father once|She burned to sleep with him, and she couldn't come up with one good reason why she shouldn't.

Would she have the courage to throw caution to the wind and act on what she wanted? "I made us something to eat-as well as tea with lemon and honey to soothe your throat."

"Thanks, but you don't have to wait on me," he answered, his voice more gravelly than usual, punctuating her point about the need for tea|Mac gently tipped Aimee to the ground then lifted her high, making her squeal again. He settled her in the crook of his arm and turned to greet Gordon.

"In question?" Isabella asked. She bade Mr. Gordon sit down and took a seat herself on the sofa.

Mac perched on the sofa's arm, still holding Aimee|Out of the kingdom. Don't tell anyone where you're going."

Maram struggled beneath him. He let her up, feeling that if she went to Haidar, it would really be over.

He caught her back against him as she straightened her clothes. "I'm not letting you do this, Maram|* * *

Both Burnett and Holiday walked Kylie back to her cabin after their powwow. She'd managed to get through the talk without lying by keeping the topic on the vision. Kylie hadn't told them anything about Jenny or about her father repeating his message concerning them being together soon. To be honest, she tried not to think about her dad's message|“She’s always been fearless in her search for knowledge.” Alyssa explained, “We’ve read every book in the compound several times including the old set of encyclopedias we found in the attic.”
Gabe’s smile vanished as he asked, “I’m surprised they allowed that.”
“They didn’t know,” Alyssa offered quietly, “I was six years old when my parents brought me to the compound|“The rope hardly even moves when he’s on it and it doesn’t even sag that much.”
Connor smiled and elbowed Andrew, saying, “Yeah, for such a big guy he sure is light on his feet.”
Andrew chuckled, but in the back of his mind, it did seem odd.
“I’m going next,” said Andrew|"I can't believe this," I scorned myself, fumbling with the zipper at the back of my dress. "What was I thinking?"

Don't cry, Mia. Don't cry. But that's what part of me wanted to do. How could I be so stupid? How could I forget who I was dealing with?

"I gave you specific instructions for the party, Mia|It had room for each Pegasus to stretch its wings freely and comfortably, and each stable was labeled with paint of the creature’s names. I took Shadow to his stable in the corner, which came complete with a food and water trough, and riding gear. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Shadow|“I can’t do that.”
“It’s not safe here.”
“Yeah, Tony mentioned I couldn’t be walking around by myself anymore.” Her eyebrows drew together. “Wish he would have mentioned he was spying for your mom a lot sooner.” I knew Grandma Sidney had been battling a crush on Tony|But it was only 9:00 a.m. Maybe she'd spike her coffee-Italians liked their liquor.

She smiled with false cheer. "So what are we making today?"

Mama Conte slid a well-worn piece of paper over to her and pointed. "That is our recipe."

"Oh, I figured you knew enough not to need a recipe|"You mean you guys?"

"Exactly."

OK. Fair enough, she nodded thoughtfully. They would just have to come up with a solution.

"We should begin negotiations with other Midnights and see if that's going to be a recurring theme," Caia suggested.

The Council nodded, but Reuben sighed, "It's not that easy, Caia|I hurried back out to find Ed Thayer bouncing anxiously in Mr. King's chair as he pulled up information on his computer. His eyes were too bright and his hair stuck out at odd angles. He was pointing animatedly to the computer screen, his voice cracking and rising an octave as he spoke.

"I found the virus! It was hidden in the back subcode..." Thayer beamed as he showed Mr. King how and where he found the virus|Taking small, deliberate steps, she walked into the living room, collapsing onto the white leather sofa.

She'd had the most dreadful day. Within the space of a few hours, she'd fainted, learned she was pregnant and been abandoned by her husband. The prospects for the future didn't look bright|"Where is she now?" Roman asked.

"In the cafeteria, eating a gourmet meal," Gregori replied. "I'll take her to my office in about ten minutes. You can meet her there."

"All right." Roman sipped some Bleer. "You're doing very well, Gregori|Later, her father took her and Vince aside and gave them a check for a hundred thousand dollars "to buy whatever else the two of you might need," he said, "or to put a down payment on a little house of your own."

"Dad, this is way too much," Cara said.

"I told you I was a rich man," her father reminded her.

"I know, but..." She looked at Vince|Once again, he slid his dark sunglasses down his nose and drilled into her with his fierce golden eyes.

Helena's body stiffened. "Darn it," she spoke under her breath. Where had the crazy redhead cabby gone? Helena hadn't even paid her.

With no time to lose, she raised her arm and flagged down a new yellow chariot.

Again, the stranger made no movement towards her as she loaded herself in a cab|That sounded a little X-Men... heightened sense of intuition... Her jaw dropped. "You mean he's psychic?"

Christopher cleared his throat. "Not exactly. Well... yes... but not in the way you imagine. I sense things about people."

"Well that's nice and vague, now I really believe you're a psychic|She hadn't imagined that, and he actually lingered, really studying her br**sts in her tight T-shirt, making her shift her feet in discomfort. It was absolutely the wrong time for him to behave like that, and even worse was that her own body reacted positively to the attention. Marley bit her lip and shifted her purse in front of her chest.

"Do you have a child, Marley|Abe stood up and pointed at a metal chair that looked like it was made out of silver vines.  It wasn’t there before. Abe had Zach bring it in from where I didn’t know.
“Please have a seat,” Abe said casually motioning towards the chair.
David looked at the chair first then back at Abe|"Aw, poor baby," I said as I put a mushroom in his mouth.

Annie put the potatoes in the oven as Luke handed Tom the coated chicken and put it in the skillet. Tom was a handsome man who stood about 6'0" tall with a muscular build. His short, sandy brown hair and hazel eyes reminded me a great deal of Luke|"What pack has brown eyes, ringed by blue and amber?"

"The Helki pack, who live around Bendigo." His eyes were chips of glittery ice in the hazy light filling the room. "It's simply a matter of asking the right questions, Riley."

I sipped my beer. "What can you tell me about the Helki pack|“I knew it, I knew it, and you guys always thought I was crazy for thinking that.”
“I think it was the body buried in the backyard part that didn’t quite add up.”
“Yeah, well, the skull wasn’t found in Vanny, so it’s got to be in the backyard.”
“No, Johnny B, it doesn’t have to be in the backyard|Even if the SA grunts had opened fire, they would have only caused an explosion so close that it would have disabled the gun and killed them. Instead, fifty-six SA grunts, eight of them with red flashes, poured through the doors of the silver car, onto the waggon to defend the artillery laser.
“With me!” yelled Jonr, leaping onto the flatbed, under the barrel. The two remaining able men, followed by Ishmael, leaped onto the waggon and opened fire on the SA grunts|When he emerged, a trail of steam followed him. He took her hand. "Come with me."

She entered the luxury bathroom and her lips parted. "A bubble bath?" Her face softened. "Trey, you're a genius."

"I try." He went to the faucet, turned off the running water, and began undressing|Personally, I’d so much rather receive something hand-made than something designed and built in a factory. The sights and smells of Christmas were overwhelming. It all made me happy. I looked over at Aaron and realized it was having the opposite effect on him. His glow from the ice-skating seemed to be fading. 

I saw a hot dog vendor and looked at Aaron|He could feel that energy; the adrenalin was rushing through him. Bob rushed down and he searched the crowded platform. He couldn’t find Karl anywhere. He searched harder and a train pulled into one of the platforms. Bob looked all over and in the third car from him, he could see Karl getting in. Bob got in and slowly made his way to Karl|She spun around knocked the first guard the the ground and had a second in her arms. She used his weapon to disable the other guards and then shot him in the leg. Before letting him go she threw out a small shiny marble, it rolled a little bit and exploded into a bright light.

All Terrains in range fell to the ground. The woman then ran out of the terminal and outside to a small ship, dropping a few more of her marbles|They inched their way over the ground - a slow, painstaking process that seemed never-ending. The heavy fog was their only protection once they emerged from the forested area to the campsite itself. Tempest sent up a silent prayer that the thick vapor would prevent their presence from being detected.

Darius felt the disturbance ahead. He had made his way through the line of intruders, the male leopard coming from the opposite side to meet him at the campsite|Sparkled eyed her suitcase nervously, and Lacey decided to use an oldie-but-goodie distraction trick, one that would hopefully keep her daughter from checking and rechecking her suitcase for items she might have forgotten for the rest of the night.

"Are you taller?" she asked Sparkle. "You look taller to me."

That drew Sparkle's attention away from the suitcase|It looks like a snake. Is it a symbol of Achilles?"
"Yes, it is a snake, but has nothing to do with Achilles. It was my pet, its name Argos, like the ship of Jason, for I allowed it to wander through the palace."
"You allowed this snake to roam your brother's palace|Piper stumbled, her arms tight around Amanda's waist. She reached for the screen door at the same time Mark turned around and went to his car.

He spat on the ground and wiped his face on the sleeve of his sweatshirt before climbing into the truck. His parting words were lost to Amanda because she was backing Piper into the house, keeping her eyes trained on Mark|You'd have to be blind or stupid not to realize it.

And even if Santa's beard had been real, the Santa she'd just consulted was just like every other grown-up. Once Haley tried to explain about the angel, Santa had gotten that look in his eyes. It seemed to Haley that if anyone believed in angels, it would be Santa|Just as he hadn’t needed to search for beauty, neither had he needed instruction when his father had given him his first camera. The cool, silvery plastic casing had fitted his hand as if it had been made just for him, and he’d know, even at the age of nine, he’d know that this was what his life would be.
Soro didn’t need to go looking for beauty|"That's just crazy," she said.

"It's not about the kiss this time, it's about what it means. In some lives we can kiss, but in most we can't." He stroked her cheek, and she wrestled with how good it felt. "I must say, I prefer the lives where we can kiss|I was not in the mood for his 'friends only' hugs. No freaking way.

I couldn't stop the nasty snark that bubbled up. I glared at Danny, who was giving me a nervous smile, as though he knew niceties were not the agenda for the evening. "I seriously doubt you were looking for us, Danny|"First urine, for what?" I ask confused.

"This!" He holds the pregnancy test in front of my face, making my breath catch.

"Why do you have that?"

"You're late."

"I'm late?" I repeat, not taking my eyes off the test|I wasn't all that psyched about what crazy ideas Nathan might be planting in Jeb's head, to be honest.

And then, one day as I was obsessing over all of this for the thousandth time, I shifted from worried to huffy, because really. Why was Jeb choosing to spend time with Nathan Krugle over me?

So that day in class, I jabbed him with my pen and said, "For heaven's sake, Jeb|He tried to fend her off as she pulled him into the driver seat.
Vain approached from the parked skimmer. The Human made sure the sheriff wasn’t going anywhere and got out, letting the air escape from the vehicle.
“Seren...” the Romulan began.
The Human gave her a brief hug then guided her back towards the skimmer|I told them the price and I heard Wanda gasp again. "Stop it, Wanda, " I said, "and give me your hat. " The two old ladies put on our crazy hats, which really suited them. They went off look- ing extremely pleased. "But we're not in disguise now, " said Wanda|"What's she doing here?" Jealousy was written all over her pinched little face.

Jack glanced at me before turning to face his future bride. "She came to see me. She wanted to talk."

"She's trying to stop the wedding, isn't she? She doesn't want us to be together, Jack|The bony creature leaned over and grabbed the lantern from the bow and handed it to him.
“Stop freaking out,” Vanora said. “He’s just trying to give you the light.”
“Oh,” Angus said, feeling silly. He nodded to the skeleton and took the lantern. He set the light and the shield down and offered a hand to Vanora|I’m going to call in a very detailed anonymous tip to the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA – just to be sure – you know they don’t communicate that well between themselves.  They’ll find the device today.”
“How do we get back home?” I asked Roman.
“I was sent as an in-and-out job,” said Roman|“The last two should be a different color.”
Joni replied, “Why do you say that?”
I brushed the stars with my fingers. “Those two weren’t earned, they were political awards.”
Joni shook her head as she laughed. “Please. If anything, those are the two that you did earn|Snuggle my head right up in your armpit and snore for three days."

"My armpit?" Mark repeats. "Good thing we all showered up in the storm this morning. My pits smell like roses. Go ahead and get comfy."

She shifts and wiggles, then settles again. "I seriously can't believe we're still alive, Mark|"So, you're a producer, Ms. Quinn?" he asked.

"For a show I approved last week," his father interjected as Ms. Quinn's hand fell away. "Haven't had a chance to speak with you about it yet."

Cole asked, "What kind of show|However, on this Sunday evening Janet had escaped briefly from the lab for a few games of tennis with Jerry Pinkney. Jerry was as inconsistent on the tennis court as he had been in academic studies, but in her present unpractised state Janet was thankful for a partner to rally with her.
"You gave me a good workout," she said as they left the court|My feet were warm and dry, at least, and I made myself stamp the snow out of the treads of my boots before I hoisted myself up into the Jeep.

"Wait!" Bobbye Sunday slogged through the snow, holding her hands out for balance.

"I'm sorry I was so short with you," she said, when she'd reached the side of the Jeep|He was about to take off after the holograms, luckily he had hesitated.  His orders were to stay put and keep an eye on the outside of the Palace but when he saw the girl and boy running in among the trees his instincts forced him to stand and ready himself for the chase.  He hesitated, after all he was supposed to follow orders and this hesitation delayed his hunt long enough to notice two people running, really fast, for the alley way directly across from the Palace|Victoria slid off his lap, grateful that he didn't stop her this time. "You mean he....Dharr please tell me he isn't suspecting that we're back here kissing!" she exclaimed, her hands covering her mouth and her face turning the becoming shade of red he was coming to expect now.

Dharr didn't think she'd appreciate the fact that his driver and the guards that were in the front seat, not to mention the ones that were following in the SUV behind him, would assume that he was doing much more than kissing|I turned and looked out the window, at our sweeping grounds and tall fences that more than ever before needed to keep one of us safe. And, beyond that, I saw the black stretch of Highway 10 and the lights of Roseville-the other world that existed just outside our reach.

"Normal," I whispered. "She's just learned she's never going to be normal|"Well, I think he's better than James Blooey," said Blake.  "And who else is there?"
"YOU!" cried Trudy.  "You're clearly the best choice!  Why would you even THINK of voting for anyone else?"
"If I vote for me, I'll just be throwing my vote away," said Blake|"I need to speak with my father, please?" Lucas asked without any preambles.

"One moment Lucas." He was put through to his father a minute later.

"Hello son, how are you?"

"I'm getting married and I want to get it done this week. I'm busy with work so can you take care of the arrangements|Ansel holds the door open and I follow him in, quickly greeted by a tall, rail-thin man with a welcoming smile. The restaurant is small but cozy, and smelling of mint and garlic and something dark and delicious I can't immediately identify. A handful of small tables and chairs fill the single room.

"Bonsoir. Une table pour deux?" the man says, reaching for a stack of menus|to Ivy upon their return from the mall made her want to scream.

"How'd your research into our parents go?"

Ivy asked as they strolled past the cemetery on the way to Ivy's house.

"Pathetically," Olivia answered. "You know how many sets of twins there are from Owl Creek?"

"I can think of at least one," said Ivy|David shifted and started to speak.
“No, detective,” I said first. “I think I’ll just wait to have my lawyer with me when we just talk.”
“Of course,” he stood. “Well, here’s the drill. You’ll be here tonight in one of our cells|And we can reach that level of capacity through geometric growth if the existing units reproduce themselves, with the new units doing the same over the next few months. The classic example that illustrates this concept is that of starting with one Credit and doubling it every day. Do so, and in less than a month, you’ll be a millionaire|All down the line, the “Foxes” had done far better than Ellison.  The one thing they hadn’t done better was to score more points.
“That makes me sick,” said Mr. Miller after going over the results, “Those kids worked so hard and did so well under the conditions.  It’s a shame they didn’t win|Next, she looked at the gym where she saw five people, two played basketball as the others lounged about on yoga mats. 
When she realized they were just students, she continued to the double doors. Easily, she applied pressure to the handle and broke through the lock. 
As quietly as she could, she walked through the halls, toward the gym|Perhaps the fact that I don't argue with him about it right away is proof that he might be right.

Thankfully, Fredrik changes the subject. "Have you had breakfast?" he asks.

"I'm not really hungry."

He leans away from the wall, dropping his hands to his sides and then steps around in front of me. Jerking his head back once he says, "Come on, I'm starving|On the third night toward the end of my shift I heard a scream from the east.  I checked quickly with my partner on the other side of the pass and he heard it also.  We reported the noise and were told that a squad would be at our location in ten minutes with night vision goggles.  
Before they arrived we spotted movement at the bottom of the pass|“Members of the Legion live up to a higher standard, however, so while you can pick any of the five physical education classes available, the later periods are generally more intense.” 
Monson didn’t say anything. He wasn’t sure what to say.  
“I would also suggest that you use one of your elective periods for additional strength—" 
 “Question,” interrupted Monson|Gabe staggered back toward the chapel clutching his stomach and dragging his sword behind him. Mike strode forward to meet him. Rafi climbed down inside the chapel to check on Cora and the children. Alyssa struggled to reach the top of the debris, jumped down to the grass and ran toward Gabe. 
Gabe collapsed in Mike’s arms. Mike lifted him easily and spun to head back to the chapel|"It's nice to run through the streets when we're not really on a call. Makes me feel like Speed Racer."

Jess frowned as they passed the interstate ramp. "Wouldn't the freeway be faster?"

Jimmy laughed. "For you, civ. We don't have to stop for lights|'The trouble is, you see, that if you do know Right from Wrong you can't choose Wrong. You just can't do it and live. So... if I was a bad witch I could make Mister Salzella's muscles turn against his bones and break them where he stood... if I was bad. I could do things inside his head, change the shape he thinks he is, and he'd be down on what'd been his knees and begging to be turned into a frog... if I was bad|“I mean, it sounds like maybe she knows this man, only she doesn’t want you to know it.”
“Why would she lie?”
Officer Tucker looked away.  “People lie for all sorts of reasons.”
 “What about the cut on my hand?”
He shrugged.  “I’ll file the report.  If it’s any consolation, it’s not much of a cut|A hush fell on the crowd as the deer descended lower and lower in a wide circle to finally settle to earth on the roof above them. No one moved. They could hear the sound of hooves prancing above their heads. Silence. Then heavy boots walking.

Everyone turned their heads to see Santa by the tree, piling presents everywhere. He stopped once to grab a handful of cookies as well as some carrots Sara had her children set out for his reindeer|He looked at the calendar app on his phone. “I have to go to Chicago in two weeks for a deposition.” 
He paused and said, “Oh, that reminds me. Do you have a problem testifying in court?”
“No. It goes with the job. Actually, I frequently hire PI's so I don't have to testify|Everyone loved her. How could they not?

"This recipe is one I got from her."

"From Hannah," I breathed, abruptly drawn away from my musings.

"We were talking about our favorite dishes and she told me about this one. The next day, she handed me the recipe|I wasn’t sure what to expect, so I clung onto Gabe.  We passed through a thin veil of fog and then the ship slowed down.
“Very smooth,” said Rasmus stepping to the bow.  “The Alfheim know how to make portals.”  He then looked at Ian.  “Sorry, don’t mean to offend your family’s trade, but they do know how to make portals|The moment they were through, Chris hit the accelerator and worked his way up the gears, the zombies shrinking along with the horizon.
“That was close,” Maisie said.
“It was more than close. I need to make another stop.”
“What for?”
“I think I need to change my underpants|"I might have to agree with you, dear. Next time we try this, remind me to take some Dramamine."

I give her a sideways glance. "You look like you're going to be sick."

"Just look at the road, not at me," she orders. "My looking sick has nothing to do with your driving|"I don't know. But we have to get out of here, or we're both going to die." Her fear was contagious, but it made no sense.

"Kelly, you're not being reasonable. If-" "I'm begging you, Diane." Thinking about it later, Diane never knew whether she gave in because of the urgency in Kelly's voice or because it was the first time Kelly had called her Diane|It did seem to sober him up a little bit, though. He was no longer swaying as he walked, now fixated on Jenna as she playfully made her way to the elevator. The three of them got in, and Jenna pushed the button to the top floor. Tracy felt as Mr. Hayes began to rub her backside, and she looked over to see that he was doing the same to Jenna|“ If I’m not mistaken, you are a new resident of our little town and as the owner of this restaurant, and a neighbor, I want to welcome you.”
“ Why, thank you so much. This is very nice of you.”
“We enjoy spoiling our customers,” Kate said with a wide smile.
“I’m very glad to meet you, Kate|A few minutes passed, which seemed like hours to me, and there was no increase in the numbers; only the three now visible, all moving slowly around the roof.
He leaned forward, picked up two shells and loaded them into the twin barrels. Then, before closing the gun, he stood up and nodded in the direction of my Mother. She, in turn, stood and grabbed my arm to pull me back a couple of paces further behind and to the side, away from the shotgun|It was the first time he had publicly acknowledged him aloud as a relative.

The earl did not comment. Not directly, at least. He just muttered, "This is a disaster," and walked over to the window.

And said nothing.

Nor did anyone else.

And then, in a voice low and furious, came the earl's comment|Antares crouched, lightning crackling from his tail, and everyone stood still. Shawna untied her sword and raised it. Orin did the same a few feet in front of her. Lula hovered near her, sprinkling dust, and holding her nose with both hands.
“Do not sneeze,” Shawna hissed.
“Aye wohn’t,” said Lula, right before she sneezed|I see her embarrassment.
“Paul,” the predator supplies his name but does not offer to shake hands. Instead he sits back in his chair and deliberately gives John the once over. A hint of… aggression in Paul’s attitude seems to annoy the dog.
Looking a little miffed and then worried, John says, “Nice to meet you, Paul|A filthy man with a rusty knife?

Maria gave her head a shake.

It's the wind again.

No, it can't be. This side of the bed isn't facing the window.

A rat?

Could be a rat.

"I came in fourth in Iron Woman last year. I'm not afraid of a little rat|He sat up in bed, swung his legs around to the floor, and stood up. Donald backed off to give him room. "What is it, Donald?" Alvar asked.

"It's Fredda Leving, sir."

Alvar looked at Donald sharply and felt his heart suddenly thundering against his rib cage. "Yes, yes," he said impatiently|Just call me Sam."

"Sam?" He wrinkled his nose at me. "I don't know."

"Why not?"

"It's just that Sam doesn't really seem like the name of a duchess." He looked at my face and backpedaled. "Not that there is anything wrong with Sam|The security guard was peering suspiciously at them now, and she forced a laugh. "I can't believe you forgot it," she said loudly and nonsensically. Damon was looking at her like she was insane, so she flicked her eyes toward the outer door. "Let's go get it."

"New plan," she said, once they were outside and out of sight of the guard|“You wouldn’t dare,” Elijah growled. I squeaked as he was all of a sudden an inch or two behind the rogue. “Tell me, rogue, where is Delilah?” The rogue stiffened. “On behalf of the Vampiric Council,” he whispered. “I hereby order you to tell me the whereabouts of Delilah|His hearing was too sensitive not to have picked up on it.

"Bring her here," Sebastian commanded. "He'll come. Nothing she can say will keep him away. In fact, her shrill warning will only make him hurry, make him sloppy. I couldn't have planned it any better."

With one hand over my mouth and the other across my waist, Heather pulled me back against her, picked me up and carried me across the room to Sebastian|"They're in that one," the judge said. He watched Jason walk toward it, then turned and left the room.
There were two men in the first cell Jason passed and one in the second. All of them glanced up with hate-filled eyes, but no one spoke to him. Jason moved on until he stood outside the door of the last cell|Did you-did you know about all this? That the Reapers would find the dagger and free him in the end?"

The goddess slowly nodded her head, her eyes steady on mine.

Confusion filled me. "But-but why? Why would you let that happen? If you knew that I was going to fail, then why would you tell me to look for the dagger|“I hope it to be a seamless transition to another emperor, as long as the Guard does its duty and honors the will of the Council.”
The indirect accusation of dishonor did nothing to Antonio. “Well, Bruesio. What would you say if I offered you a thousand gold pieces to change your mind?” 
“A thousand gold pieces?” Bruesio scanned the room, as if to look for spies|I entered Aidan’s address into my cellphone and soon had directions to a residential area in the nearby town of Cambria. My cellphone directed us to a posh-looking gated community called Canterbury Estates. We drove past a couple of times uncertainly and then finally pulled in. The security guard at the gate looked at me inquiringly. I was unsure of what to say, so I said, “Uh, we’re here to see Aidan|Her aunt also forced a smile. Campion hoped hers was more convincing. “I’m delighted that my dear niece was so helpful, your ladyship.” The gimlet glare fastened on Campion and, despite the warmth of the countess’s grip, she repressed a shiver. “And so self-effacing. You didn’t say anything about meeting Lady Ravenglass, Campion|Ares flew in for him but Gregor waved him toward the mice, some of whom were unable even to get to their feet. Suddenly the cinders vanished and he was wading again, this time through a shallow river with a current. He plucked a struggling mouse pup from the water and hoisted it onto his shoulder. Fortunately it was able to cling there on its own because his arms were soon full of a second pup|I want to believe that she won't do anything, but I've seen her do too many crazy things to make any assumptions about Violet Hayes. I decided to step forward and again I mentally curse myself for being so drawn to her.

"Hey." I position myself between the two of them and look at Violet|The only reason he gave me this internship was because he needed someone to cover his classes while he did his Hawaii Lectures and I was the only one who could actually do it,” said Allison.
“Yes, but still, said Katrina before Allison interrupted her again.
“No buts about it, I’ve got to cover him,” said Allison|Suddenly, the dream of what I presumed to be the previous night returned with a vibrancy of an electric shock; my trek through the jungle, the rain, my descent into the earth and that strange door. A shudder danced up my spine as I recalled how the door seemed to breathe with a life of its own.
The image of the bas-relief door struck a chord of familiarity and I picked up the tome, scanning its pages. There near the center of the book was an engraving of the very door|“200 years there and 200 years back?  You cannot do it.”  
“In which case you can play the piano and sing, too.”  Mozart burst into giggles.  
“Me? I can barely play a note,” said Herr Schack, “—compared to you.”
“You better start learning, then,” said Mozart|Jakob reached for a heavy book from the table to whack the spider with but, as he leaned forward, the spider leaped at him.  He screamed and ran around to the other side of the table.  The spider landed on the wood surface, turned and pounced again, this time landing an inch from his hand.  Jakob grabbed the white box and very quickly, dropped it over the spider|The entire apartment was white paint over red brick and had industrial piping attached to the ceiling that entered and disappeared through the opposite walls. With some stuff she brought with her, she made it feel like home. It was clean and cozy. And it was hers.
When she went to register for her classes at NYU, she discovered she had a full scholarship. Being able to stretch her classes out, she started working on a new play|My psychometry kicked in, but the only vibe I got from the box was a sense of supreme and utter calm, as though I had closed my eyes and was sleeping peacefully. Hopefully that's exactly what the Protectorate guards would feel when I used the dream dust inside on them.

And now, it was time to take out those guards.

So I squared my shoulders, gripped the box a little tighter, and headed in the direction of the first guard|“Boy that tastes good,” I said, “even if it’s not beer.”
Max looked at his watch. “It’s still morning, what do want with a beer?”
“I don’t know. Guess I shouldn’t complain, though.”
“Not when it’s free,” said Max|He would be far away from the little witch and he'd finally have peace.

After a few more frustrating minutes of searching he finally found the pouch he'd been looking for, tucked way to the back of the shelf in his closet. How that had gotten all the way back there, he couldn't tell. He'd probably been in one of his mad moods when he'd thrown it on top of the shelf|"Yes, a large rug with a story-"

"I know what a tapestry is Martin." He returned his attention to the desk, rummaging through more books. "You know, I may have been wrong about you - you're no threat, you've simply lost it. You've been drinking the Kool-Aid too long, Martin|While they were sparring, Amy took a moment to look at the younger woman with fresh eyes. With the family connection made, Amy saw the resemblance now-the sandy-blond hair, the shape and color of their green eyes and the matching dimples.

"Sabrina, meet everyone here." Roper inclined his head towards his sibling. "Everyone, meet my sister, Sabrina|Whether those two facts were connected, time would tell, but right now she was going to assume Julia was telling the truth. At least the truth as far as Julia remembered it to be.
Ronni forced a smile onto her face and walked back into the room. “I caught her just in time, Julia|Outside the shooting is much louder. The family ran through the wreckage of buildings and cars and finally reach the doors of the evacuation center.

“You're lucky you got here, these are the last two transports out.” said the guard as he closes the door behind them. Hundreds of people are pushing and shoving their way to get on the transports|“I thought it would look good in the gun rack of your new Jeep,” her dad said, grinning like the Cheshire Cat as he danged a set of keys in front of her. 
“A Jeep!” Indie squealed, clapping her hands together. “Wait, it's not pink, is it?'”
Her parents laughed. 
“No, hon, it's not pink|"It's north of the river, you could probably get a tram," suggested Sacha.
"Aren't there usually posters announcing things like this, telling people where to go?" I looked from Sacha to her mother.
The old lady seemed unsure. "I haven't seen any, have you, Sacha|Part of a memory that I just can’t remember.
So when a fair passed through town last year I knew what I wanted to do. I wanted my own totem of power. My own source from which to draw strength. Aden watched as I got the emblem tattooed on the back of my neck. 
Rhoda was the angriest I’ve ever seen her when I returned home with the tattoo|He did not say anything for a minute. It looked like he was thinking hard and picking out just the right words.
Finally, he spoke.
“Bobby, one thing you have to understand: no one owns baseball."
He let the words sink in.
"Sure, we let the owners build stadiums and pay players and even charge for tickets to get inside but, they don't own baseball|OMCOM introduced a timer delay into his own interface so that he could ‘speak’ to the simulation in what would appear to be real-time.
 “What am I?” asked the simulation. 
 “You are an emulation of my thinking processes,” replied OMCOM. “You are a copy of me. You are pseudo-OMCOM.”
 “Where am I?” asked pseudo-OMCOM.
 “You are operating within my memron modules,” replied OMCOM|It was the kind of smile that I'd seen before. The kind the boxer gave me right before he killed me in that dirty fight.

"I have a proposition for you," he began, pulling his hands down from under his chin and pushing out of the chair. "One that you won't be able to refuse|Finally, though, I decide it'll make me look suspicious if I don't, so I gently connect my hand with his and shake it politely and a shiver goes down my spine.

Do I know him?

"I'm Maddie Asherford," I say.

"It's nice to meet you Maddie|My eyes watered a little, but I made sure Michael didn’t see that since I knew he’d laugh at me.
At the next bar, I hesitated. I wasn’t anxious to get yelled at again. I let Michael go first and watched him as he did the first customer. He finished the first shoe and began the other without spitting and everything seemed fine. Picking up my box, I ventured ahead, looking for a customer|I don’t blame you for your reactions to this. This is a very mysterious and frightening letter. It’s strange, your Great Aunt didn’t strike me as being an eccentric, paranoid person. She has always seemed to be very grounded and realistic. However, this letter seems to indicate otherwise.”
“ How could you have come to the conclusion that she was well grounded|Let your race be warned, Kandrigi, for I grieve for them and their destiny.
‘Tell me of your vision, Kandrigi. Let me share your burden.’
Through time it comes from afar; in time it will cross the path of your earth.
‘There is a mystery here that I do not understand, Kandrigi|I know this has something to do with his brother. My heart softens a little for him. "I can help... if you need something. I mean, I know we don't know each other, but-"

Tegan cuts me off. "I don't need any handouts."

"What? I'm not trying to give you a handout|And even if it were, people live and die by nonsense. It's not what is so much as what people think is. Tell me, young man, putting legends to one side, what makes you think Demerzel is a robot? Let's suppose that robots exist. What is it, then, about Demerzel that makes you say he is a robot|He led her to the bleachers, his walk more of a strut as he shoved his hands in the pockets of his cargo pants. His shoulders slumped, his dingy ball cap concealing his gaze as Haven scanned the crowd, spotting Dia in a center section.

Before she could thank Nicholas, he'd already slipped away.

Haven headed up the bleachers, her nervousness waning as she took a seat beside Dia|Cole paused. "The sooner we get back into Missouri, the better off well be. If we push it, we can be across the line before dark. Then we can unload the horses in Westport tomorrow morning and still be home by supper time."
It took the three only a moment to organize the horses for the trip back to Missouri|Katja didn’t have the heart to tell her she wasn’t going through with it.
The studio was on the edge of a residential area at the back of a brick building. If she hadn’t had the address, she’d never have known it was there. It made her think it couldn’t be much of a studio|"There was a town I heard of once back in Italy many years ago, where they said a phantom stalked the streets of Umbria. It wasn't a ghost, but a being created by strong emotions. The story was that a man became so enraged at his unfaithful lover that he kil ed her and her paramour, and then himself. And these actions released something, a being made out of their emotions|A voice, hated – loved – so smug.
“But Aveia, what exactly is obedience?”
I smiled, although I was beginning to feel uncertain.
“It is… well, to do as I am asked.”
Ser’paent curled himself around me, seeming to think.
“But what is it when you are not asked|Just because some wanderer had come into the picture, it was no excuse to treat her harshly. Back in the chambers Tabetha felt terrible for the way she had spoken to Ruby. It was just that for once she wanted to be free to do whatever she pleased without anyone to scold her about how careless she was being. She took her cloak and went out to search for Ruby|All of them were waiting for his instruction, waiting for the chance to prove themselves worthy, so that they might be dismissed from here as proud members of the town’s militia. Proud members, Sir Nickleby scoffed to himself, and shuddered to think of what that Black Wolf had done to his men. Proud members had been torn down that night, all because of the Wolf|If it’s gold leaf over wood it’ll sound just like wood. If it’s solid gold, it should give a thunk.”
Mr. Tolley got Freddie into position.  Freddie put his ear against the steeple and tapped.  Down on the ground we held our breath.
“I think it thunked,” said Freddie.
“What do you mean ‘You think it thunked|"We don't have a lot of time. I think it's best if we use the skills you already have, rather than you exhausting yourself trying to learn new ones."

"I am not useless," she growled, the feral sound surprising Madoc.

"Of course you're not," said Madoc|"Ah," he said, his cheeks plumping with a smile. "You received them. Not a bad fit, I see. I have other clothes being readied for you, my dear. But this will do fine for now. How are you, darling?"

"Good. Thank you for these. And for the rose," she added, realizing it had come from Marron, along with the clothes|I tried to console myself with the fact that she said all their 'dates' were strategic, meaning that they only went places where she would be seen with him, and she was certain it would get back to Cole. She told me that they hadn't ever been completely alone on a date, and I was curious what Sam thought of that. I wondered how much he liked her and how much he would hurt when she dumped him and went back to Cole|he asked warily.

"It's Mi-" started Anna, but her uncle put a finger to her lips, shushing her.

"But Uncle Joe," Anna whispered. She didn't think her dad could hear them, although she knew his senses were heightened. "Why can't we tell him about-"

"Not now, Anna|I pulled on my brown boots on over the skinny jeans.

Expecting to hear my phone again, I couldn't place the noise at first. It was the doorbell. Someone was buzzing me from downstairs. Liz must be here after all. I jogged to the door and punched the call button. "Be down in a sec, Liz|He jumped out at them with a scream made for Hollywood, just as Jesse started running at full speed towards them with his sickle and chain. Russell’s leap at them from behind left the group no choice but to run in the darkness down the opposite end of the hall screaming. Craig took one last look, trying to see who it was, when he saw Russell|“You mean, Corrado, that I am sitting here in the vast office of a world-renowned art scholar surrounded by Renaissance beauty the world never sees and you don’t know who the artist is?”
Verdi shrugged. “Cedric, you must understand, Italy is full of buildings like this one that are covered in such works. There simply isn’t time to examine them all. Neither is there the money. We need your program to help us, Cedric|I start to say no cookies, but I feel Karen push me ahead towards the main cabin and the ladder.  A minute later I’m on deck.  Ron is at the wheel and Jason and Lawrence are up on the bow.  We’re much closer to the shore than before.
“You want to take it in Seth?”  I nod to Ron and slowly walk over to the wheel|You were seen with Prince Korram at this very tavern recently. Did it surprise you when he showed up here?
“It certainly did.” Jeskie laughs. “You don't expect to see royalty in a place like this, specially after he'd been outta town so long.  I was helpin’ out here for the evenin’, and when I came out to see what the guests who had just sat down wanted, I realized one of them was the prince|His secure hold caused her heart to thump even harder. "H-how many times do I have to tell you? All I need is something to eat and I'll be fine."

He stopped ushering her along when they entered the kitchen. "Mattie?"

"Stop your hollerin', Zachary. I'm old, but I ain't deaf|"I should tell you that the night Melissa caught us was the last time." She paused. "Deep down, I know that if we could do everything over again, neither of us would've done it." Her eyes held Anne Marie's. "I'm not just saying that, either. It's the truth. If Robert were here, he'd agree|"There are"-she counted fast-"at least thirty Synestryn in there. They know we're coming; they're on either side of the opening."

Nika sent the information to Madoc with a thought, so he could see what she did.

"Drake, take the right side. I've got the left," said Madoc|He wipes some blood off his forehead that is coming from a cut on his hairline and then winces as he pulls his hand back, flexing his fingers. "I didn't want to get hit. I wanted to get into a fight."

Okay, now I'm just confused because that sounds like something I would do and I've never met anyone who has a weird obsession with danger like I do. I want to know if that's why he wanted to get hit|"I thought there's no such thing as time for you." I'm trying not to whine. "Come on. I need hot chocolate. My feet are freezing."

Dad sighs, then strides across the yard to stand between Christian and me. He puts a hand on the back of my neck right under the hairline, then does the same to Christian|In September I began another story, 'Mother Earth,' and submitted it to Campbell on October 12, 1948. After a comparatively small revision of the ending, he took that one, too.

'But can you be certain? Are you sure that even a professional historian can always distinguish between victory and defeat?'

Gustav Stein, who delivered himself of that mocking question with a whiskered smile and a gentle wipe at the gray moustache from the neighborhood of which he had just removed an empty glass, was not an historian|"For you, I'll try."

Hadley flicks her eyes away again, feeling like an intruder. She wishes she could slip outside without their noticing, but Charlotte is now smiling at her again with an expression Hadley isn't quite sure how to read.

"Has your dad had a chance to tell you about-"

"The father-daughter dance|"Nope," he told her and took the single step separating them. Standing alongside her, he looked up at the family photos and waved one hand at them. "Not a single one of those people is the type to settle for second place."

"Sometimes you don't have a choice," Bella said softly.

"There's always a choice, Bella|The older man might be highly respected, but he rubbed Aeron wrong with his superiority. Aeron hadn't had Torret for a class; the older professor didn't teach often now, but Aeron knew he was well regarded.
"That's quite impressive, Professor." Aeron wasn't sure what else to say.
"Yes, it is," said Torret|"I'm going to shoot you in the ass with the nail gun unless you start talking."

"All right, we may have had a bet." He holds up his hands in front of him.

"You may have had a bet?" I repeat, my finger on the trigger starting to tighten.

"Okay, okay...we had a bet|I did my same morning routine, but I had a new idea of what to do about the weapons down stairs: dodge whatever came at me. I walked down the stairs, ready for anything. Today the surprise was ten ninja stars, three bullets, and what looked to be about eight tons of rock. Believe me, I didn’t count, Star told me later. As planned, I successfully attempted to dodge seven of the ninja stars and one of the bullets|Cassie had never seen her this depressed, even when the hunters first burned their symbol onto her front lawn.

Faye also pretended not to hear Diana's warning. She refused to acknowledge that she'd been marked at all. Cassie noticed she was still wearing the opal necklace Max had given her, the one he'd stamped with the hunter symbol.

"You can take that off," Cassie said, pointing to the necklace|"We don't want any store-bought cookies," Eric argued.

"Don't try and bake any, either, Mom, not after last time." He looked at Lesley, and whispered, "Even my friend's dog wouldn't eat them."

Lesley smothered a giggle.

"Will you or won't you give us some cookies|It's why I hesitated for two days to come forward. I had to be comfortable in my own mind I was doing the right thing. So the answer is yes, I'm convinced there's a very good chance our serum will cure this terrible epidemic. But how can I guarantee it won't create a greater suffering until it's tested|“There are others, more stringent ones, all aimed at removing obstacles to seeing clearly.”
“Yes,” said Clare. “Yes, I know.”
“Is that really true?” said Roth from behind them, obviously now listening in on the conversation.
Ruth turned to him, “Absolutely.”
“I’ll be damned,” said Roth|She and Olivia had only revealed their twinship to Toby Decker, a reporter for the school paper, on Friday, but when he'd told them that he'd succeeded in writing up the story in time to squeeze it into the upcoming Wednesday issue, the girls knew they finally had to tell their parents. At school today, Olivia had seemed almost as nervous about telling her parents as Ivy was about telling her dad.

"They are so excited about you, Ivy," said Olivia|Besides, it was either this or the clown.”
“I see your point,” I said picking up my costume.  Sometimes I wondered if Jackie was made of money.  She worked, but always had a lot of cash.  “Where did you get the money for this?”
“I have a rich uncle,” replied Jackie|“I neglected to tell you Natasha was coming,” I said to Axel. I added, rather acidly: “Actually, I thought it would be a pleasant surprise for you.”
 	“It is pleasant,” he forced himself to reply. “I am genuinely puzzled, though. There’s been nothing on the news about this”
 	“We chose to keep my recent discharge from hospital a secret,” said Natasha|"Why? What is it that you know?"

"Just a feeling," she lied.

"I don't like that feeling," he said.

"Join the crowd." She blinked. "Just teach me to fight, Lucas."

Appearing resigned, he picked up the two swords|It wasn’t bad, she thought as she stopped crying and started smiling. In fact, it was very, very good.
Some people stopped to look at her, which made her smile all the more. Excited, she stood up on a garbage can and read aloud in her clearest, strongest, most important voice. The more she read, the more they listened|He flipped the calendar to November before muttering to himself, "November has Thanksgiving, and then December is Christmas. No one wants to have to go to a wedding during the holidays. I think we should wait until after New Year's. What do you think about a January wedding?"

He glanced over, his hand still holding the calendar|"Where were you?" he asked.

"We went to the Catacombs," I replied. "...to make sure Gavin has begun to heal of the gashes Claudia inflicted upon him, then we stopped by the Vale." I motioned to the shopping bags we were holding.

He didn't even bother looking at the bags|What do you think that does for my self-confidence, or my feelings about myself?”
“I can’t explain what you have, because I don’t anymore. I lost it in the mirror. I don’t even remember what it was. But I know it can get worse. I didn’t think it could but it did.”

‡  ‡  ‡

There was a large black velvet Dr.ape over the mirror|I wonder what those secrets are-I wonder if they're as f**ked up as mine.

"Nice to meet you, Tristan," she says, giving me a once-over, in this slow, lasting way.

She takes one last look then turns to Quinton, smiling, but it doesn't quite reach her eyes. "And good to see you again, Quinton|"Why are you worrying about that trinket?" commands the large man who appears to be in charge of this ... costume party. Or whatever this is. "The Tarasova pearls are all over the floor, and you simply let them roll away from you."

"We have them, Your Imperial Highness," a woman whispers as she and a few others-dressed less grandly than the rest, including me-begin scrambling to collect every last one of the pearls|"Thank you."

He inclined his head before he flashed himself to the living room. Leta followed after him, knowing they were the only thing standing between Aidan and death.

She glanced back to the bedroom where he slept before she whispered a solemn vow. "I won't let you down, Aidan|“Yes, you know they were miners right?”
Syll nodded. “I do.”
“We didn’t get a long so well. You know that?”
Syll nodded again.
“This isn’t fair. You know everything about me and I know almost nothing about you.”
“That is exactly the way it should be,” said Syll|Her voice held a combination of warmth and pleasure as she scrambled to put down the equipment so she could greet him. "I probably should have gone out and bought a ladder, huh?" A sheepish grin spread across her face. "I was just so anxious to get started and keep busy, I didn't want to wait."

"Why didn't you call and ask me to pick up a ladder|We can but hope that the agony from the pain he must have been suffering in the time before he died was brief.”
The Headmaster paused in his eulogy and looked toward the curtains behind him. The curtains parted. An officer followed by six soldiers, all in full dress uniform emerged, marching crisply, and stood at attention each side of the coffin. The officer, facing forward, stood at the head of the coffin|Tristan grabbed her and pulled her against him. She whimpered and struggled. All that got her was the tightening of his hold. She once again looked to the hunter for help.
“She can’t help you,” Tristan growled. “Even if she wanted to. Tryn?” He turned to Trynnadon and nodded to the hunter|But it has really strong instincts."
"Are you aware that at five eleven this morning, two people in Scottsdale were discovered with their throats torn out?"
Indal's hands and feet went cold. "No, I wasn't aware of that."
"What did you do this morning, Indal|To accept his offer, sign his contract and let him be off, back to his real life before she became so attached her heart would break at his leaving. Besides, she'd gotten her sister's warning glare earlier and knew that Cara would never forgive her if Maura didn't sign on the dotted line, allowing her sister to earn a small part in a big-budget American movie.

"So what's it going to be, Maura|If you were to view the question in terms of a probability ballistics analysis-"

"All right, Donald," Kresh interrupted. "We can take it as read that nothing could be as safe as a positronic brain robot. But let's forget about theory here, Terach. You've told me how the New Laws or Three Laws can be embedded into a gravitonic brain|He stopped and threw his hands on the desk, splaying his long fingers over the smooth grain.  “It's not just our immediate pack that is in danger.  Our whole species is in trouble.  We have to be diligent now more than ever before.  There are less and less pups born every year, and the ones that are born are non-gifted.

He lifted her captive, wounded hand and put it round his neck. Their mouths met and clung, exploring.

Above them the candles began to dance. A big hawkmoth had come in through one of the windows. It whirred round the chandelier. The girl's closed eyes opened, looked at the moth|In Florence?"

"I don't know. I'm sure none of the children have ever seen a pony, let alone had the chance to ride one. I thought it would be fun."

Gabriel observed his wife's excitement with no little amount of joy.

"If you look after the gifts for the children, I'll find a pony|"We're not going to bite, Mr. Jacobs," Zane said, trying to placate him, Cameron could tell. Zane's lips twitched. "No more than the cats, anyway."

"The last stranger who messed with them ended up with stitches from temple to lip," Cameron mentioned to Ty.

Ty merely made a clicking sound with his tongue, not moving as he continued to hold his hand out to the cats|The Duke of Wakefield had a voice to make angels-or devils-weep. It wasn't the type of male voice currently admired-for the high, unnatural voice of the musico was the rage of London at the moment-but his was the sort of voice that would always seduce the ear. Sure and strong, with a vibrating masculinity on the low notes|You are fifteen years old and in my car while we’re in France and I will see to it that nothing happens to you or your brother.”
“Okayyyyy, fine. Can we just stop talking about this now? I’m tired of it.”
“We’ll talk about for as long as we need to, Sarah.”
“That’s not what you said back at the airport...”
“Sarah|With this thought turning inside his head, he saw in the distance that the road began to change, the grey stone appearing to widen and as they drew nearer, it soon became apparent that this was indeed the choice of paths that Dredger had alluded to. The road split in two, branching off in opposite directions.

They stood at the threshold of the two separate roads, one leading into the east, the other into the west where the desert prevailed.
"Ah, to find the end of this," whispered Dredger|The ever-ready attraction crackled. He saw it echoed in her eyes, along with wariness.

"Truce," she repeated, sipping the coffee carefully. "Where to next?"

"Travel day, actually. I've got work to catch up on this morning." Not a total lie, since he always had work|"The lease on the Jerzy farmland expires at the end of next month," Simon said. "The West Coast leaders have decided the lease will not be renewed, and the land will come back to the terra indigene. The hamlet's land lease expires at the same time. It, too, will not be renewed|Maybe she'd be splintered and crazy, but she'd live, which meant Madoc would live, too. He'd get Tori out alive. Then maybe he'd find a way to save her again.

"No!" roared Madoc, pounding at the bars.

Nika looked away from him, unable to bear the sight of his pain|He's a monster. That last thought sobered her up. She approached the benches.

"Grace," Nassar said. His magic brushed her. "This is Alasdair, my cousin."

Alasdair unfolded himself from the bench. "Charmed."

"Hello." Grace nodded at Alasdair, then turned to Nassar|The distant grunts and moans of the now approaching zombies seemed to add to his mental and physical unsteadiness.
“If you’re not back in a few minutes?” Jane asked. “What do you expect us to do? Why don’t we just try to drive through the gate now, or back around or something?”
Sven looked back toward Route 29, coughed, and then turned back to Jane|It will make it easier for you to do your maid of honor duties."

"Maid of honor? Wow."

"Of course. I mean I was going to be yours..." She trailed off. Kelly and Tom were the only people in town who knew about Adam. I'd made her swear not to tell anyone with the exception of Tom|Richie, as well as Matt, was breathing a small sigh of relief.  Tess almost laughed at their reactions.
“Good.  Who have I got, Richie?”
“That’s Strawberry. He’s a good boy too.”
They rode along together in comfortable silence for a spell.  Richie glanced at Matt who nodded, so Richie walked his horse a little faster to catch up with Tess|It's true. She is dressed in a stunning red gown underneath that shawl. Her earlobes are clasped with diamond earrings.

He tenderly brushes away a tendril of her curly hair from her face.

"Thank you for the dress ... and the earrings," she says shyly.

"Don't get too attached to the earrings|“Takes a lot of willpower to get over some things. Love is one of them.”
I twisted my head slowly, was this the start of a heart-to-heart conversation with him? With the once unreadable and unwelcoming George? It must have been the champagne.
I took the plunge, “have you ever been madly in love, George|"Are you sure about that?"

Reaching the car, he swung open the door as his friends hopped inside the car. He gave a brief wave before disappearing.

"Kyle's huge," Rachael announced. "And hot," she added.

Fin looked at her. "Don't go lusting after a soldier, Rachael|“Don’t worry, Emma,” Kacey assured her, “We’ll do something together. It’ll be fun!”
Emma’s face crumpled as she said, “But I get stage fright! I can’t perform in front of an audience!”
Ava’s expression became earnest as she said, “You don’t really have a choice, Emma|I consider it, but not for very long, and lay my cards down on the table. "I'm in. Now what do you have?"

A soon as his lips turn upward, I know how it ends. He slaps his cards down on the table. "Get nak*d, Ella May."

"You had the f**king ace|“It may come to that, if you don’t help me now! If Peter’s really dead, then I need to get in touch with our next-in-line as soon as I can.” She gave Jenna a speculative look. “I don’t suppose he clued you in? Gave you the code words?”
“I didn’t even know him, really,” said Jenna|"It...it's the rabbit..."

Dimitri assessed her, and I hoped he wouldn't look at her wrists. When he seemed satisfied she had no gaping wounds, he asked, "What rabbit?" I was wondering the same thing.

With shaking hands, she pointed at the trash can. "I cleaned it up. So Natalie wouldn't see."

Dimitri and I both walked over and peered into the can|The air was cool and fresh; the sky above was unbroken blue. He ran up and down the hollow to warm himself, beating his arms against his sides.
Sora awoke. She shivered, huddling in her cloak. Korkungal encouraged her to run with him, but she declined. She watched him run for a while and then climbed out of the hollow|asked Luxa, glancing down the corridor.

"More than a hundred," said Vikus. "We have lost about thirty so far. The Fount was hit harder. Eighty have died there."

Luxa did not let go of Gregor's hand until they were directed into separate bathrooms to wash. Before her fingers left his, she whispered, "Thank you, Gregor|Soon a cry like a duck in a power dive was heard among the damp, dark hills.

The pre-dawn light was grey on the horizon and a shower of sleet had made the leaves sparkle when Granny Weatherwax left her cottage. There had been so much to do.

What she'd chosen to take with her was slung in a sack tied across her back with string|Piercing's in my nose and lips, eyebrows, and my ears are studded heavily. I'm dressed in black, a short skirt, boots, and a crop top that shows my ribcage. Right where my scar is now, there used to be a tattoo, cursive font that traced the name Evan.

I touch my side and whisper, "Evan|He cradled me against his chest like a child. I tried to tell him I would walk, but when I glanced back at the truck, the words died on my lips.

"Are we taking that?" I asked shakily.

"Yep."

I began to shake. He stopped and looked between me and the truck|"It is a list of substances and associated tonnage," said White cloud, as he glanced over the list. "We will need to study the list, but my initial impression is that it will prove very difficult to provide them everything that they want."
"But it is a huge positive step just to have such a list|"I don't want to lead any infected to the house, Jenna."

"They're not that smart. They don't know where you're coming from unless you get caught standing in the yard or they hear someone inside."

Dad sighed, annoyed. "You don't know that, Jenna|"

I looked back at him meaningfully. "Well?"

"Well, what?"

"Don't make me spell it out. I'm in this dress, and I don't want to be alone. Come inside with me. You owe me a dance, you know."

"And you know I don't dance|"You're crazy, you know that, right?" Jesse took a long pull of his beer and stretched his legs out in front of him, crossing them at the ankle.

Justice shot a look at his younger brother in time to see him shaking his head in disgust. The sun was hot, the breeze was cool and the patio was empty except for him and Jesse|You stayed in one piece," she said, looking him up and down critically. "Your pants are too short. Want some French toast?"

Gregor followed her into the kitchen and sat at the table while she made breakfast. She filled him in on his grandma's condition. "She's not doing too well, Gregor|I twirled in a circle to make my drunk act appear complete.  In hindsight, I might have overdone it.  I also hadn’t thought it all the way through.  
Detective Reiss stood up and approached me. Instantly, I knew I had to get out of there.  I edged toward the exit.   
“What’s your hurry,” said Reiss|He waited a moment, and when she didn't so much as blink, he brushed his hand across her forehead and trailed his fingers down the curve of her cheek. He followed his hand with his mouth and inhaled her scent as he pressed his lips to her temple.

"We're here, honey," Noah said, his voice cracking under the weight of his emotion|Violet looked around as if searching for their youngest sister. “I haven’t seen her yet this morning.”
“All right.” Iris headed back toward the door. “You hunt up Rose, and I’ll put my horse away and change. Then we can leave.”
“I suppose you’re champing at the bit to get a mail-order husband, are you, Iris|From all Langdon could hear, she was trying to reason with a madman--insisting that Langdon could not be expected to decipher the pyramid without going to visit the Almas Temple. "That building obviously holds the missing piece to this puzzle! How can Robert decipher the pyramid without all the information?!"

Langdon appreciated her efforts, and yet he felt certain that "Eight Franklin Square" was not pointing to the Almas Temple|"I suppose you think I'm a nothing but a camel with an entire canard pond stuffed into a hump, in case I have to cross a desert!" 
"Good grief, no!" exclaimed Macklin, sweating now. "The thought never crossed my mind!"
"This thing on my back is a mole," said Polydoor.
"Umm...you must be very proud of it," said Macklin|"It's for the best."

"That darn Bernice. I told her I didn't believe a word she was saying about you and Jeremy." Jemma Leigh tossed her head. "As if my best friend would ever mess with my husband."

Summer's eyes grew huge. "Someone told you I was messing around with Jeremy|Last night had been wonderful. She couldn't remember a time when she'd been so happy. Throughout the night Edward had made love to her, taking her to new heights of pleasure and back.

"What the f**k, Zero?" Edward said.

Opening her eyes she became aware of the gazes falling on her and Edward|And most did learn to accept.
When she didn’t respond, Sebastian said quietly, “Go to bed, Flora. Rest. Until George has picked his bride, there will be little time for relaxation. I know I can count on you to keep the peace between us.”
She nodded, found the energy for a benevolent smile from somewhere, and waited until he was through the door and closing it behind him to say, “I’m sorry, Sebastian|George took a moment to admire the craftsmanship and sleekness of the gun before tucking it into his jacket pocket, and walking to Frank’s office.

Busily looking through some paperwork while waiting for the conference call, Frank glanced up when George walked through the door.  Great, what does he want?
“What may I do for you today, George|How did you get interested in wilderness backpacking?"

I could tell Jude didn't want to talk about himself anymore, and I decided to respect his privacy. "Calvin was the first person I knew to backpack the Teton Crest Trail," I said, treading carefully. It was a long, messy story, and I didn't know how much of it I wanted to tell Jude|"And what is your name, sweetheart?" Javier finally turns his full attention on me and the girl at the door sighs in irritation that he's ignoring her.

“I’ll take care of it,” Ki-Mal said as he took the scroll|Autovisors were particularly despised by Rick.
There were many other little touches that bothered him.  Some decorating genius thought that it might make the Vectra feel more like home if they installed ceramic tile in the bath and kitchen areas.  Now first, he wasn’t supposed to call it a kitchen.  His wife kept reminding him not to call it a kitchen|It's a shame that Denaphaos insists that we compete at their stadium for half the local tournaments."
Again, Promander wasn't listening to her. He was staring intently at a man selling flatbread sandwiches. The vendor had long, greasy hair and prominent, uneven teeth. He smiled too widely at the women he served|He wasn’t the same to me anymore; he always had this mask on his face, hiding himself from the rest of us. I had to find out what was wrong, and soon.
“Jazell, are you paying attention?” Emily’s annoyed voice broke my day dreams.
I snapped back to attention, “Uh yes, I am Emily|I swung the car in a wide right, starting to make the turn, when I saw a small road that split off behind a stand of trees. To the left of the entrance was a wrought iron sign that read Haven Drive, just the one I was looking for.

I guided the car through the trees and realized that it wasn't a street, but a driveway|“Anyway, I have to go find my friend—”
“I’m right here.”  Beth appears from nowhere, package of tights in hand.  She smiles at Nico, and I can clearly see Nico’s shoulders relax.  Beth has that effect on people.  They exchange greetings and Beth asks me, “Did you get the umbrella?”
My breathing is uneven and it’s hard to tear my eyes away from Nico|"I think I need to..." The blond-haired girl comes strutting up the aisle, swinging her hips, and he trails.

"Well, looks like you have a stalker," I mutter.

A smile takes over his face. "Jealous?"

Together Theo and I walk up two flights of stairs and along the hallway until we reach Paul's door. Hoping against hope, I knock and call out, "Paul|"I hope you're right Nisha," Rachel said. "He's part of a giant bureaucracy and momentum can shift, leading to bad outcomes. We must be careful to fly under the radar."

Andre would have done anything to honor Jacques's requests for the care of this box|The set that had been built was a magnificent one, designed to resemble a Fijian bungalow with no sides. There was a thick, layered, thatched roof, and rows of benches off to the side. An ornate wooden podium stood in the center (Chip's place of honor) and there was a bench on each side of him. We were instructed to file in quietly and take a seat on one of the benches across from the podium|Assuming it was one of my band mates, I opened the door with just a towel wrapped around me to see Bentley standing there in a nearly sheer night gown.

I slipped my hand inside and pulled out the other photo|She'd been waiting for the guillotine blade to fall, but it still hacked her to pieces when it did. She'd been avoiding all media-and people-like the plague. Anyone who'd known she'd been to Damhoor had wanted to relate news of the country and its exciting new hunk of a king.

Her daughter only called her that when she was feeling very emotional; Olivia hadn't heard it in years. Justine's beautiful blue eyes filled with tears as she smiled at Olivia|Only pure desperation allowed me to talk. I had to say anything, anything at all to distract Arachne.
"So, how come your name is Arachne Jr.?" I blurted. It worked. Arachne lowered her hand, and an easy smile spread over her face.

Henges circled round stone rows, with dolmens placed upon opposite ends. Faces were carved into the rocks.
People avoided this place as much as possible, as they feared the unknown by instinct. Basha, however, had learned to appreciate the stones.

Jed seemed to hear me anyway, because he was striding toward me now, his gaze focused on me like a laser beam. Dad, still holding my hand, looked at me and then at Jed|They both turned to look at her and love shone in their weathered expressions.

Sofia leaned back against the soft leather seat. "And what is that? What does it take?"

Hunter glanced out the window just as Ash's horse trotted up alongside the carriage. "My dear, one must desire to be fixed."

"And he doesn't want to be fixed|"Now," said Kay, "we need something to bring us back to the land of the living," and she busied herself with glasses, bottles and ice. Janet fixed her with a serious stare as they started on two large martinis on the rocks.
"I hope you won't think it impertinent if I swear you to a bond of secrecy."
"My lips are sealed," replied Kay|"You have no idea what you're talking about."

"Maybe not. But we both know Marco is a good person. He doesn't deserve to be feeling the way he's feeling." She shrugged, shot me one last searching look, and said, "You think on that."

My visit with Bray, Belle, and their mums was somewhat poisoned by Leah's decision to try to force my hand in the situation with Marco|Too hard for him to be able to sleep, even though the next day was apt to be long and difficult.

Peyna was fully able to appreciate the irony of his position. All his life, he had served the idea of the law. Ideas like "prison break" and "armed rebellion" horrified him. They still did, but certain truths had to be faced|This is the first time that he’s ever let me travel with any other family. He trusts that I’m safe with your father. Besides, I heard that the Polish Jew is one of the most despicable. Have you ever seen one?” she asked.
“Well, to be honest, I’m not sure that I have ever seen a Jew|A wave of relief swept through her body until she noticed Joanna beside him, clutching onto Harry’s arm as if she were holding onto him for dear life.
Cristal wanted answers but not to the expense of having Joanna listening in.
“Harry, we need to talk.”
Harry must have noticed Cristal’s anxiety. He glanced down and pulled his arm from Joanna’s vice-like grip. Joanna put on a show by glaring at him, crossing her arms and pouting|He would likely be immensely angered to learn you had feelings for Jason, but unless you acted on those, I doubt he could ever bring himself to hate you."

I shook my head. "Even then, it doesn't make having feelings for Jason right."

"No, but you are not declaring that you didn't love David by facing the truth that you love Jason|I don't want you to step on the glass." He moved me aside, since we were both still wearing just our socks.

"I'll get the broom," he said, leaving me standing there, still holding the kitten.

How was it possible? Why would they be in the same picture? Clearly, they were close if they were in the same picture|Before Magda could ask her question, Nadya said, "That wasn't a real child. Why did she take it?"

"It was real enough."

"What will happen to it? What will happen to her?" Nadya asked, a wild edge to her voice.

"Eventually it will be nothing but crumbs," said Magda|He had followed Paul here from the Mairie, after refusing him access to old town documents. We left quickly to get away from him. That was why I didn't leave you a note."
"I know who you're talking about. It's Jacques Vallin."
"Excuse me, but did you say Vallin|The shampoo in his hair combined with the clean smell of his t-shirt. She sighed his name. They raised their heads to look at each other even though it wasn’t part of the sequence. As Beth whispered, “I’m ready now,” Arturo’s phone rang.
The teacher said, “No phones in class, Arturo|That never happens at home… “No, not at all, sir.”
“Alden, you may tell no one. You are sworn to secrecy.”
Alden nodded.
“While I have no confirmation of this, I have reason to believe Andy has been brought here to break the curse,” the King whispered.
Alden glanced quickly at the King and then at Andy|“So, they’re organised?” Sam’s voice is thoughtful.
“You haven’t encountered that?”
Sam focuses on pouring hot water into the cups. “Maybe but I never heard the word Prefect. I probably would have thought of a school prefect.”
“But you have seen signs that they’re organised|"Maybe we could go out to Burning Man, in the Black Rock Desert. It's supposed to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Or we jump on a plane to England, hit the Glastonbury music festival. I've always wanted to check that out. And Barcelona, and Florence. But I guess first I'll need to get a passport|As lab partners went, he was one of the good ones: actually doing the assignment, instead of slacking off, or fooling around like so many of the other guys in her class. The least she could do was make sure he didn't fail.

"I could take you through the material, if you want?" she offered. "Sunday afternoon, maybe, at the library|It's quite-quaint... Oh, I hope you'll excuse me, but isn't your husband's name Lawrence? It seems to me that it's Lawrence."

Claire's teeth clenched, but she had to explain. She had to. "Tony is a friend of my husband's. He's helping me select some things."

"I understand. And quite a dear about it, I imagine|“I’m good, but my groom to be has run off again,” Olivia responded.
“What do you mean, ran off,” asked Amber.
“His aunt has taken a turn for the worse and he went to be with her again.  He assures me he will be home in time for the wedding but I’m worried,” said Olivia|The Alchemist met my eyes wonderingly.

"I heard ... but I didn't believe.'

"Sometimes,' I told her, "I still don't. It goes against every rule of the universe.' To my surprise, she touched the small gold cross around her neck. "Some rules are bigger than the universe|His job needed him in DC, but his family welfare meant he should be here.  Family wins.
In San Francisco, Peña’s cozy business was unraveling all around him.  He didn’t know what to address first.  He called Number One.
“What can I do for you, Luca?”
“Are you on your way to DC|Most packs had a scapegoat, picked on and driven away from food, pushed outside of the pack hierarchy, and they'd often travel hundreds of miles to start another pack, somewhere far away from their tormentors.

Once upon a time, Salem, an older wolf I'd never known as a human, had been the omega of the Boundary Wood pack. But I had seen enough of Shelby when I was clawing my way through the meningitis to know that she had fallen low in Paul's eyes and thus low in the pack|I'm wearing rented skis, rented ski boots that feel weird and tight and make me walk funny, plus every other kind of snow gear my mom was able to convince me to put on. I drew the line at goggles, and I stuck the unflattering wool hat into my jacket pocket, but from the neck down every inch of me is covered and padded. I don't know if I can move, let alone ski|Away from the water that had changed everything for me, that had changed the lives of all of Jace's close friends. None of us would ever be the same again. But I knew that I couldn't protect myself from that kind of pain. Because, like Bethy, I was just surviving now. With Harlow gone, I had no reason to smile|Until we can get some leads, we’re keeping a close watch on you,” said Vasquez.
“I have to call Allison, she’s coming home today,” said Katrina.
“Does she have any family she could stay with?” asked Vasquez.
“Yes, she has a couple of cousins who live in Hyde Park.  She’ll probably stay with them,” said Katrina|“My dear Truman,” the letter had read, “I, Mr. Dawsley, of the Atlantia estate of the Dawsley family, do greatly wish for you to attend a night of dining and conversing if it so pleases you. Show up whenever is convenient for you, my door is always open.” The letter had been signed simply, “Dawsley|She turned around and bumped into Victoria, who could see panic in her eyes. “What’s up?” Victoria asked.
Sara waved her hand in the air, as to say, “I need fresh air.”
“Come on.” Victoria made her way and pulled Sara with her through the crowd.
As soon as they got outside, she turned around and looked at Sara|You want to sever our friendship just because I want to buy you the two dresses and the scarf?” I ask playfully, holding on to the blue scarf again.
“Yes. So do we have a deal?” Ivy starts peeling at my fingers again.
“Yes, we have a deal.” I smile.
“Good, now let go of the scarf|Ellie buried her face in Maji's shoulder but no more scared than the average little girl was with a stranger. Maji rubbed her hand across the child's back in small circles. It was strangely satisfying to feel the muscles relax under her touch.
'It's rude not to introduce us.' Trina chided.
'Have you ever known me to have manners|So you have these stressors-some of them good-that can't be eliminated. And you say they're causing you to backslide. How so?"

I ticked the list off on my fingers. "I'm agitated. I'm anxious. I'm paranoid. I'm accusatory."

"That sounds like me on my period|"As your employer, I'm finding this all rather...amusing."

"You would find it amusing." Leave it to Will to use this to embarrass her even further-although a moment ago, his reaction had been quite different.

"I prefer to kiss rather than be kissed."

"Oh, you have rules for such things," she murmured, not pointing out that he'd done his share of the kissing|So he opened his eyes again and stared down into the fire.

"We were supposed to take a helicopter to the top of a peak and then ski down. But the night before the run, I met some blonde in a bar-" he stopped and realized "-I can't even remember her name. Point is, I blew off the ski trip in favor of spending time with the blonde|It was her favorite thing in the world, and it had been too long since she'd last been able to enjoy it.

When the waitress left, Lily glanced up at Seth and asked, "Why did you follow me?"

His lips twisted into a rueful grimace. "I don't even know how to answer that, Lily|“Oh yes, it is most certainly real!” Nostos laughed. “If you’re found guilty you will go to Fa’owai prison.”
“And if not?” 
“For the purposes of the show, you’ll be a free man!” Exclaimed Bryan. “Of course in reality, you’ll go to Fa’owai prison|Cleve and I went back a long way and as tired and fed up as I felt, I was glad to see him.  He leaned over and pecked my cheek.  
"Katie, how are you?" he asked.  I stood back to let him pass and the door swung shut behind us. Cleveland was the only person besides my brother who was allowed to call me Katie|Wouldn’t it be incredible to travel with them?” She turned back to Aaron, her face aglow with delight. “Maybe there are faeries in the clouds that are watching us right now.”
“Faeries?” Aaron said in surprise.
“Yes, faeries,” she repeated. “Master Rutlidge, our tutor, always scoffed at the idea of faeries|I tire of hearing of him."

"There is no reason you should hear of him, Sire. He is one of those phenomena that are thrown to the surface of the news for a while and then disappears."

"But he doesn't disappear."

"Sometimes it takes a while, Sire|Jakob pointed towards the wolf, shakily.  "Your baby!"
The Cyclops turned her head sharply and peered into the cavern.  Noticing the wolf, she shrieked and bounded back down the passageway but Jakob knew it was too late and she wouldn't reach her baby in time.  Before he could stop himself, he sheathed his sword and leaped off the ledge, hoping to stop the wolf from taking a chunk out of the baby|Out of what grave or cave she'd come we were never to know either. And I understood now the full implications of all that Jesse had been telling us: There never would be answers to our questions about Mekare. There never would be a biography of Mekare. There never would be a voice speaking on behalf of Mekare|He punched a code on a keypad on his car’s dashboard.
The square started lowering.
When he’d dropped twenty feet or so, a black opening gaped in front of the car.  He hit the accelerator and roared into the tunnel beneath Lake Anterra.
 
WHEN he stepped into HQ a few minutes later, he smiled.  Corey always smiled whenever he got back to HQ|“ Would you like anything else…perhaps ice for your eye ?”

He glanced up, considering a retort, but simply nodded when 

he saw her sober face.

While she ordered, he removed a small tape recorder from 

his pocket and set it on the low table between their 

chairs.

She raised her brows when she returned and saw the 

recorder|A few raindrops fall on the statue's head, and they snake down his face like tears, leaving behind dark trails. I squint. The face is not as detailed as I'd expect. In fact, it looks weatherworn.

"How long ago was the Plague?" I ask.

"I'm not sure," Elder says, strolling away from the statue|The park had not been overly crowded for this event and there were lots of pathways through the corporate tents, and lots of ways through the park to the parking lots and streets.  A few people even helped those with babies and strollers.  We were still on our best behavior.
Once we were through the last of the tents, I even stopped to look back at the river.  The water was already in the first of the tents|You have to-"

"I know who your mother is," he stated calmly. "Now tell me about Joe Solomon!"

I let the words wash over me, tried to find the center of my rage, of my fear, before I slowly whispered, "The pigeons. Mr. Solomon told me to follow the pigeons|He looked at a smooth spot on the water, hiding so much treachery under its calm surface. A young life gone.
The others were too busy celebrating the victory just won, to be sharing this grief. One of them ran back to camp to summon help.
In time some men arrived, and were told of the tragedy|She was free-free to love Ammar as she knew now she wanted to, love him fully and deeply and completely.

And she wanted to tell him so.

She watched the room darken and twilight settle on the rolling desert hills, casting long violet shadows on the sand. She felt a new sense of both peace and purpose, and with a smile she swung her legs off the bed and went in search of Ammar|`I'm glad you didn't liken one of us to the unglamorous hippo, a creature who takes equally well to both land and water,' said Angeline.

`What I mean by land creatures is that Angeline and I are into treks, expeditions, you know, beholding gorgeous mountain scenery.  We climbed Denali last year,' said Bergitta.

`Took the West Buttress route,' said Angeline|Gabe and another man were raising the door on the back of the truck as Alyssa and Samantha appeared from the hallway. Alyssa held her breath expecting a huge pile of mangled animals tossed throughout the truck from her rough treatment last night. She was rewarded with a neat pile of wooden crates of various sizes that appeared undisturbed. Alyssa rolled her eyes at her own stupidity; of course, the animals would be in crates|asked Haleton.
“I suppose they represent the number of people who have died. We’re up to number three-fifty one,” said Craig.
“Scroll down to the number 777,” suggested Haleton.
“If it goes that far,” said Craig. He scrolled down the page, stopping at the number|We get a lot Japanese clients coming through the club, but I haven't explored the country beyond that."

He began unbuttoning his shirt, "If you had ever spent any time in my home country, you would know the Japanese have a somewhat peculiar talent that your own country does not."

It felt like her heart had moved from her chest and set up permanent residence in her stomach, but she couldn't keep herself from asking, "What kind of talent|Adam nodded and then began to peruse the menu. He decided what he wanted quickly, set the menu down, and said, “What are you going to have this evening?”
“That shrimp tasted so good last night, I think I’ll have that.”
“I don’t think you can go wrong with the shrimp|It's been days since..."

She shrugged my hand away from her arm and sat back on the cot. "My dear prince..." she hissed. "You really should find out what the extents of your punishments are before you dole them out. I was injected with a serum to delay the healing before the lashes were inflicted on me. As long as the serum is in my system, I will not heal|She tried to distract herself by reviewing theories, deductions, and projections about the mission and soon, her sadness washed away. Uonil saw more people enter the derasar and take their seats. She searched among them for Graid, and was disappointed when she saw no sign.
Where is he? thought Uonil. He knows the ceremony starts promptly at ten. She gazed around again for a sign of Graid|she challenged. "And what about those who aren't divorced yet, are the people in that marriage faithful to each other?"

Max was livid with her comments. "Are you saying I would violate my wedding vows?" he demanded.

Clarissa shook her head. "I don't know you well enough to be able to say that, Max|We all lean forward to squint at the tiny print: IF SCIENCE TEACHES ANYTHING, IT TEACHES US TO ACCEPT OUR FAILURES, AS WELL AS OUR SUCCESSES, WITH QUIET DIGNITY AND GRACE.

Easy. We only finished the book last week. I look around, but there are no raised hands. Wendy's trying not to make eye contact with Mr. Phibbs so he won't call on her. Jason Lovett is trying to make eye contact with Wendy|It's like a moment of silence for the many kids lost to that great unwinding machine. The industry, as Sonia had called it. A mill of commerce trafficking in flesh, working outside the realm of ethics yet within the law and with the complete consent of society.

But then Connor realizes something. "There's more to the story, isn't there, Sonia|He put his hands on the roof and tried to think where she might be. Had she said something once? A clue?
A zombie stumbled across the road about half a mile ahead, followed by another, and another. They seemed to be heading in one direction.
Chris got in the car, floored the accelerator and followed the trail of zombies|"Did I mention I inherited a few traits from my father? Just like him, I'm a deceiver. I make you see lies. I make you hear voices."

Just like this. Can you hear me, Nora? Are you frightened yet?

He tapped my forehead. "What's going on in there, Nora|I didn’t care about my broken, drunken English for I was used to it, but what did bother me was the way this puppy looked at me like I was somehow an answer for all the bad things that had happened to him in his short time on earth.
“What am I supposed to do with a dog?”
“Chuck’s cute.”
“Chuck’s a pit bull,” I said, “and he’s going to grow|Never did I have a daughter.  Now, I would appreciate it if you would change me."  Dad continued to order me.
I rested my hand on Dad's head and rubbed his clammy skin.  "Daddy, it's me, Stacey your daughter.  Don't you remember me?  I am your only child; you didn't have any sons|Nik wondered if he was still trying to rewrite the speech.
The driver parked underground where it was dark and cool. Miss Moffat stood up in front and called for their attention. “The park will be very crowded today. I’ll be carrying a yellow and blue flag. If you get separated, look for the flag|I looked up at the ceiling as tears stung the back of my eyes for reasons I didn’t even understand myself.
“Em,” Gabe said taking notice of my tearing eyes.
Gently he dabbed them away with his thumb and peered down at me with concern.  What’s wrong?”  He whispered.
I glanced at the flower quickly then back at Gabe|Just as when she'd been pregnant with William, she not only had a fairly large bump but her cheeks were chubby and her lips fuller. She was absolutely adorable, even if she would disagree. "Hannah." She tugged me toward her and I awkwardly hugged her, trying not to squash her bump.

"You look beautiful, Els." I kissed my sister's cheek and pulled back to stare down at the bump|"You seem normal. More so than usual."
"Yeah, I feel good."
"You've been quite the terror," Eric said.
Zarah's mouth smiled, but her eyes looked sad.
"Lots of people would agree with you."
"I still like you a lot Zarah|He pointed and the four mutes left to investigate. “Don’t they teach you anything on Archee?”
“It’s pronounced Ark-eye,” Paddington said. “And they teach us fine.”
“Then why isn’t it spelled Ark-eye?” Mitchell asked. “Another stupid tradition, or are you so inbred you can’t even spell|The only high point in my week was when Malloy sent me a message saying that he knew a guy who dealt mainly in exotic plants and he was working on getting the Ptellon blood for me as soon as possible. When I’d told Malloy how I would pay, he got almost as excited as he did about the troll bile. I immediately did an online search and discovered that red diamonds are one of the rarest gemstones in the world. I wished I’d known that before I took it from Remy and offered it up as payment|"Did they leave a note with the vamp adoption agency or something?"

Her dad threw his hands in the air. "No, of course not." He started rummaging around in the fridge.

"And you never found out anything about them?" Ivy pressed.

Her dad closed the fridge without taking any- thing out and turned back to Ivy|For a few seconds I saw nothing and got ready to scram, but then I noticed what might have been a large box near one of the walls.

It might have been a large box. But it wasn't. I knew all too well what it really was. It was a coffin!

I gulped, then walked carefully over to the coffin|"You look a little pale," she notes, reaching for my hand as the elevator dings.

"We need to help them remember."

"Remember what?" I ask, letting her lead me down the corridor.

"That they're kids.

No matter what they're going through, they're still kids|The M-Team, responsible for monitoring the players, were busy preparing the game world for their entrance and the countdown was about to begin. The anticipation filling the air was palpable and Leanne let herself relax as she was checked over by Mary, one of the engineers.
“You feeling okay in there, Leanne|With an arm wrapped around my waist, he supported me effortlessly, and my feet barely touched the ground as we slipped off the plane and streaked through the airport terminal.
Now that we were in cold, soggy France I wondered for the thousandth time what I had gotten myself into.

I still couldn't believe I was in France|“I was an editor. Or I should say I am an editor, although now I freelance, and not so often,” Abby laughed, “Who am I kidding? I barely have time to brush my hair.”

Carter waited at the bus stop with his sister and stamped his feet to ward off the cold. With only two school days-including today-left before winter break, everyone was talking about Christmas and what they expected to find under the tree. Carter knew that his parents couldn't afford gifts|It’s good to see you again. You’ve brought me more samples to test. Let’s hope we find the perp before I go bankrupt.” He laughed, his gaze fixed on Jane Duncan.
Fat introduced Duncan to Jake Amladi, the company founder.
“Do you have time to watch us test one of your samples|Your life force is fading," he explained patiently. He walked over and sat next to her on the floor, across from her so that he could see her eyes. "Somewhere on your body you wear my mark. My family mark is a dragon."

He held out his left arm. On his forearm was the perfect tattoo of a small dragon|The bigger the vortex, the more realms it could access. Adrian said if Demetrius hadn't stopped us in Oregon, and minions hadn't chased us through the vortex in Mexico, we could've covered all the realms in North and South America through just those two entranceways.

By contrast, the Boone vortex was much smaller, hitting only about a dozen realms|Sylvia was, as she liked to explain, "the MD's PA," and she moved in an atmosphere of crisp efficiency. He thumbed the speakerphone off; it rang again, immediately. "Richard," said the speaker, with Jessica's voice, "it's Jessica. You haven't forgotten, have you?"

"Forgotten?" He tried to remember what he could have forgotten|He ran inside when his dad opened the door.

"See you soon." Shanna smiled, then entered the cafeteria with her husband.

Caitlyn retreated across the basketball court as all the players and spectators hurried into the cafeteria. She spotted a gazebo in the distance and strode toward it. The strains of "Happy Birthday" wafted toward her, and she glanced back at the cafeteria|The step belonged to a blonde woman, or something that chose to look like a woman. She was neatly dressed in a navy blue suit and perfectly coiffed. Her face was stern and, as she met Damon's eyes, her own were cold. The Guardian who had bound them together. Mylea.

Something in him hardened into suspicion and then into certainty|He looked around, then licked his lips nervously. "Huh, so this is the Nether World? It's nicer than I'd pictured from your descriptions. Shouldn't the sky be red? And where are al the vampires and demons?" He looked at Elena and Bonnie sternly. "Were you guys tel ing the truth about everything that happened to you here|Now for the hard part. Zach dialed Joseph Rayd, the leader of the Theronai. As much as he hated it, Zach had to tell Joseph about the explosives.

Joseph answered on the sixth ring; his voice sounded strained. Tired. "Yeah."

"I need you to come to Lexi's room," said Zach|I have the authority to confiscate anything that is electronic, other than a calculatorwhich, I might add, you dont need in history class.

Mrs. Hathaway returned to her lesson, and I quickly checked my message.

Lets make history together.

I glanced up and saw Trevor peering back at me.

I shook off my dream, and Mrs. Hathaway stepped out of class|He hunched over, digging furiously at the ice cream, his face bright red.

Connor arched a brow at Marielle, and she looked away, her cheeks blushing. He bit his lip to keep from laughing out loud.

The lad completed the cone and reached toward Marielle.

I got it. Connor grabbed the cone, then passed it on to Marielle|“Come and eat,” said his boss.  “They’ve had all this food brought in for us from Lacey’s.  Nice, eh?”
On the main table was a tray of sandwiches and cakes, so Dean gratefully sat down and tucked in.  “Shall I send some down to the others|It wasn't easy to stay in town and no longer be with Derek, but Gabrielle powered through. She'd be back at her big, lonely apartment in Boston soon enough. After five days, Kayla declared she had enough interviews and footage to go forward. She packed up her crew and returned to Boston|The Archbishop was due to begin prowling the hallways straight after recess and as there was every chance that more than one of us would get filthy in the twenty-minute break, any thought of outside activity on this day was quietly cancelled. Instead, our daily dose of government-issued milk was to be taken in our classrooms. The crates were dragged inside and deposited in the wide hallway so that each class could troop out in turn, grab a bottle and return to their desks to drink it.
Mrs Payne, consumed with the fear that a spill was inevitable, kept a hawk-like vigil over the entire class as we sipped from the wide-mouthed bottles|The sin that we all carry with us in our hearts. For we all are sinners, my friends, each and every one of us, from the high and the mighty to the lowest of the low. I am a sinner. You are a sinner. Everyone sins!  But do not despair, my good friends, let us not wallow in the mire of our own shortcomings, for I am here today to tell you how to deal with your sins|“How is it you hit him hard enough to break his nose and your knuckles aren’t even red? And I don’t see any bruises on your face either.”
“You know I hardly ever bruise. Besides Scott barely touched me.” And I have the world’s best first aid kit at home.
Roland shook his head. “I don’t know what it is with you and Scott|I glanced up to Hunter who was at his dresser spraying on some cologne.

"Mom, hang on." I covered the phone. "Mom said not to worry about Ryder and go out with the boys and then we can do Sunday dinner there. Is that ok with you?" I missed having family dinners too.

"Yeah, sounds good, I'll call Mom and tell her about dinner|“Uh, well,” she said. “Actually, I came to get a bus and load up any supplies I could find. The city is in danger of being quarantined. My friends and I are leaving the city tonight. You should come with us.”
“How do you know the city’s to be quarantined|She wanted to say she'd prefer that to being what she was, but it wasn't wholly true. She couldn't say she loved Decker yet, she wasn't sure if she did or not, but she did care for the man. Certainly her heart ached at the prospect of never seeing him again. Perhaps had Stephanie been rescued from that clearing too, it would be a different story entirely, but she hadn't, and Dani couldn't be pleased to be what she was or fully enjoy the relationship forming between her and Decker|Finally, she whispers in awe, "This is a big deal."

I agree. It really is.

Bob stares at me, into me. "You ready for this?"

I respond immediately, "Yes, sir."

He swipes a hand down his face, looking anxious. "If this is about what happened yesterday in our session-"

I cut him off with a firm, "I'm ready, Bob|“I hear you,” I said sympathetically in response. “I’ll be back in a few minutes.” I entered the office where a sleepy looking twenty-something man sat with an arm propped on the desk and his head rested in his hand. His eyes were closed. I cleared my throat but he didn’t stir|No one would talk to him or smile at him or even look at him.  He had no company but the books he’d read so many times that he’d memorized them and he was aching for someone to talk to.  So when the orderly walked by, he slid quietly and unobtrusively into the man’s mind.
He saw the hall outside his bedroom door through the eyes of the orderly|“Well, then, my dear Commander, you shall have a chance to take a hiatus from your hiatus as soon as you can arrange an outside councilmen’s meeting with the king. We can’t hold this off until the next assembly.” Her hand landed soundly down on top of the parcel on the desk. “Letters.”
Staid’s smile altered into a look of sober enthusiasm. “You’ve heard from your contacts?”
Seeing the unspoken response in Constance’s fervent eyes, Staid quickly reached to grab up and open the parcel|Sounds good to me, Becky said.

How do you want the burgers cooked? Dixie cracked her gum so loud it sounded like a car backfiring.

Rare, Sebastian said.

Alexander kicked Sebastian underneath the table.

Rare? Becky asked.

We dont serve hamburgers rare here. With the tip of her pen she pointed to a small disclaimer on the bottom of the menu|“Judge Welles may owe the FBI a favor or two ,” said Roth, as if that was precisely on point. “But he cannot indict on meaningless charges.”
“What are you saying?” asked Clare Downes.
Everyone was now looking at Roth, waiting for his answer. “What I’m saying,” said Roth|Men don't find women over one fifty attractive. So, even though it feels good to be in this moment, where I've lost all this weight, I'm still looking at over a hundred pounds that need to go."
"One fifty? That's your goal? You think you'd look good at that weight|If nothing else came from her time with Sinclair, she was going to enjoy this Christmas, and treasure it forever.

She knew things couldn't go on as they were, not for always. Even Cat knew that. At the moment, Bertie existed in a bubble of happiness, where her love for Sinclair and his little ones were the only things that mattered. The rest of the world and its sordidness was outside the bubble|And they will do their best to keep the pieces they grab."

Galen looked at me, uncomprehending. "That's exactly what's been happening for three years, but you haven't been there. How did you..." A look of astonishment showed, and then, "You had a spy."

"No, Galen, I had no spy|A minute later she finally found her voice. "Can you, please, order your driver to stop? I'll take another taxi."

"Do you see an abundance of taxis around here?"

"That's my problem."

"I beg to differ."

"Listen, I have the number of the company that sent me the first taxi|Just as Candace had known about that miserable mistake Amelia had made ten months ago. Candace was the only one Amelia had told, and then only because she'd had to offer some explanation for suddenly switching to the Thursday-Sunday shifts-days when Toby would be at a racetrack somewhere.

"I didn't know until a couple of days ago. But it's been months since you two hooked up and split up, Amelia|He used Jessie’s keys to open the door, entered, and quickly found the bureau drawer where the manuscript belonged. He replaced the manuscript and locked the office door behind him.
There, that’s done, he thought, relieved.
Orson was just crossing the crypt again when he heard a soft clicking sound. 
Woodpeckers – in a marble building? he thought. 
The sound was coming from a room just off the south side of the crypt|"Lena, you can't possibly understand the choice you are being pressured to make. What is at stake."

The rain turned from a patter of tears to a screaming downpour.

"As if you could trust him. After a thousand lies." Sarafine glared at Macon and turned to Lena. "I wish we had more time to talk, Lena|“Or I’m going to ram you head-first into this prop turkey so hard you make some kind of glurmphing noise. Then I’m gonna then punch you unconscious while you’re in there.”
“You wouldn’t DARE,”  said Terwilliger.
“I wouldn’t NOT DARE,” said Duke.
“You wouldn’t not not dare,” said Terwilliger|It was a 1-1 tie before I made my move. His legs were as dense as a python, but I was quicker. I'll never forget his name ... Vic Medonia.

I wasn't intimidated, although I probably should've been. Vic was last year's state champion. But I won the match. The guy had one word to say to me after the match|“Bet you boys would like a hot shower,” he said.
“Can’t think of anything I’d like more,” replied Max.
“Well,” he said, “You’re welcome to use mine.”
“Seriously?” asked Max.
“Sure,” replied the man.
“That’s an offer I can’t refuse,” said Max|"The sword?" he asked.

She made a face. "Well, I haven't looked at it, but I'm assuming I've only got one sword that just magically appears and breaks all the rules and theories you just covered in class."

Hayden grinned and tilted his head down to see the sword|"Jesus, Cole, who raised you? The first rule about the winning streak is you don't talk about the winning streak!" Ryan punched him in the shoulder.

"You guys are just lucky we keep kissing you," Jamie said, attempting to steer the attention from poor Cole.

"I second that," Jack belted out, his eyes meeting mine briefly before settling back on his cards|"What are you feeling right now? About me dating those other girls?" Caleb laughed. Dude! You sound like a girl, wanting to share your feelings and stuff. Dating 101, Julian told the soul. Sound like a girl and get the girl. Where have you been? I thought you were supposed to be the expert|"I've always wanted an emeraldcut solitaire."

I kicked Vee under the table. She jabbed me with her fork.

"Oww! " I said.

Our waitress paused at the end of the table long enough to ask, "Anything to drink?"

Elliot looked over the top of his menu, first at me, then at Vee|Why didn't he wait until I was there so he could stage a grand scene? Not that I wanted to be part of it."
"I don't know. What do you think?"
"I don't, Detective. It just doesn't register."
"We're trying to figure out where the gun came from. His parents said they never knew him to have anything to do with guns|My brows rise in surprise.

This is new.

My body warms and my throat clogs at the unexpected victory. I ask on a whisper, "Would you like for me to read to you, Tomas?"

No answer, just a small nudge of the book towards me.

"I'll read to you, Tomas|"Sorry, I thought ..."

"You thought what?" asks Tucker, suddenly standing beside me with a red plastic cup in each hand.

"I thought you two were an item," says Ava.

"We're just friends," he says. He meets my eyes briefly, then hands me one of the cups|The new man grinned, smiling at her like she was the answer to a puzzle he'd been unable to solve. "Well, love. Looks like we should get to know each other. I'm Morgan."

"She's compatible with both of us," said Nicholas, clearly stunned.

"Guess we'll just have to let her pick. May the best man win," said Morgan|“I know many things, but it’s better if you tell me in your own words,
eh … what’s your name.”
“Steiner.”
“Steiner … right … well, nice to meet you my name is Christine, but
you can call me Chris. Do they call you Stein?
“No, they call me Steiner.”
“Alright, then … tell me your story, Steiner|Dors had not loosened her grip on the sergeant. She said, "Now, Sergeant, I want the name of whoever it was who persuaded you to make an attempt on the First Minister's life-and the name of everyone else who is in this with you."

The sergeant was silent.

"Don't be foolish," said Dors|If you hurt him, you will risk losing Zachary, too.”
I scoff and shake my head. “I can only lose what I already have, Mother. Besides Sean is a grown man. I’m sure he can take care of himself.”
“You’re sleeping with Sean to get back at Zachary|It had a rotary dial on its bulky base, and a hefty receiver perched on top.
“You know what this is, I presume?” Holiday asked.
Dino scratched his head.  “What it is, yeah.  What it’s doing here, no.”
“It’s here so someone can make calls,” said Holiday|Too weak and too winded for a run, Ray sat on the bench in the middle of the downtown mall, his apartment above him, lost in a world of rapidly moving pieces. The foot traffic picked up as the merchants and bankers and lawyers hustled to work, but Ray did not see them.

Carl Mirk taught two sections of insurance law each semester, and he was a member of the Virginia bar, as was Ray|The next moment of silence informed Felicity that she was not going to get anything else out of him, for now at least. With a final glance behind her, she picked up her mother’s journal and hurried up the steps of the cellar as fast as she could.

10.

Jamie was waiting for Felicity when she emerged from the cellar|Why do you torture me so?” Vo pulled Ana closer again.
Ana would explain it later, but not right now.
They swam back to the boat and dried off. Ana threw her tunic back on, and wrapped herself in a blanket as Vo started the engine. 
“I don’t want to go home yet,” said Ana|He immediately picked up the viewer and stared into its lenses with eager anticipation but the swirl of mist behind the lenses didn’t change in the least and he couldn’t help but laugh at the silliness of it all. That’s when the phone rang.
“Hello.”
“Yes, hello, am I speaking with Richard Dorian?”
“You are. How can I help you?”
“Mr. Dorian, I’m the gentleman that Mr. Wilson spoke to you about earlier|Nowhere. She had exactly one clue, and it was Wheeler's claim that Matt was working on a story about her.
Oh, he probably hadn't known it was about her at the time, but by now he did.
There was nothing for it. She had to get back to D.C. and talk to Matt|The Committee on Vital Forms often heard such loud protestation but this time Keel felt that the volume was directed at the woman, telling her that her mate fought for them both.

As Chief Justice of the Committee it was too often Keel's lot to perform that unsavory stroke of the pen, to speak directly the unutterable fears of the petitioners themselves. Many times it was otherwise and then this chamber echoed the laughter of life. But today, in this case, there would be no laughter|If a stranger happens to show up we’ll be able to redirect him to the right house,” Grace informed him as Casey and James darted to their chairs and waited patiently for the meal to begin.
Grace untied her apron and flicked it over her chair before taking her seat as Tom placed the card on the counter close to his own chair. Thanks were given and soon the mystery card was forgotten until later that night when Tom was helping to clean up. He stared at it for a long moment before shrugging and putting it with the rest of the cards|A man in a white coat stepped in front of him and challenged him.
“Who are you?”
Gunter took the man aside and spoke softly to him while Merlin continued towards the wounded. The voices that started out soft raised in volume, and emotion. Merlin wasn't paying attention but he couldn't help notice that the man in the white coat was berating Gunter for allowing Merlin access to the wounded|"Gunner? Where are you? Are you still with the client and Bill?"

"Hey, sweetheart. Yeah, I am. I was just getting ready to leave. Bill, Karen, and I were about to walk out of the bar."

I didn't know what to be more shocked by-the fact that he was at a bar or that his client's name was Karen|The cold was biting harder and faster as every second of daylight slipped away. If, for any reason, this helicopter ride failed, there was no way to survive the night. Not outside the comfort of Lizzie’s impressively fortified flat and not with the threat of a nuclear strike looming over their heads. They decided to stay put and wait for the helicopter|Now my kid had decided not to have children, not because she didn't want to be a mother, but because she was too scared of the world into which she would be bringing her children. That was so screwed up. I wanted to stab something.

Julie was looking at me, waiting for something.

"Having children or not having them is your choice, Julie|“Come over tonight. I’ll make dinner, and we can drink the good stuff.”
“You shouldn’t have to cook when we’re celebrating your achievement. You come over here, and I’ll cook something for us.”
There was a moment of silence. 
“Uh, did you say that you were going to cook|“I don’t really know, that’s just sort of how I’ve always introduced myself, it’s the done thing y’know.”
	“Well you should try a different tack next time” Chainsaw-boy was a little bit disappointed, that would’ve been his first chance to try out the new arms. “Are you the captain of this ship? I’ve seen you doing a lot of shouting|Only problem is, I don't know who his parents are."

"Call and ask him." He nudged her with his shoulder.

For a moment, she remained unmoving. He'd purposely touched her. And his skin, even through their clothing, had been hot. Wonderfully hot. "I can't. He lives at a ranch for kids who've been in trouble with the law and stuff|As he looked from her to Tony and back again, his dark eyes shone with interest and what Gina suspected was humor.

So how long had he been standing there?

"Adam," Tony said with a nod, stepping out in front of his sister to hold out one hand.

Adam shook his hand, then shifted his gaze to Gina|"A supersmart hot girl who reads comics? Are you kidding? You were definitely on my radar."

Hot. I've been upgraded to hot. No one has ever called me hot. Cute? Yes. Adorable? Yes, often, and it makes me want to punch them. I didn't know short girls could even be hot|I don't want to pretend that I do. Or that I want to."

Joseph stared at her for a long time. Even though she guessed he was trying not to, he looked at her with hopeful expectation lighting his eyes. "How about Paul and Andra?"

"Fine."

"Go pack what you need," said Joseph|“Moses, dear Moses.  Yes, I had remembered.  How can it be four years ago that it all happened?  Four years!  We must plan so that it coincides with the hibernation changeover.  If I am truthful, Moses, I am not looking forward to it.  With Martha asleep, I will miss her terribly and I worry about how she will manage over the next four years after that when she has been awakened and I am asleep|The girl said evenly. “Usually. Problem is, my familiar is pregnant now and I don't really want to go back to our village. People will get upset. Got that way while we were traveling.”
   “He's unhappy about it too.” The girl added carefully as I struggled with the concept of a preggers familiar|Mazes are much more complicated.” 
“How do we know we are looking for a maze and not a labyrinth?” 
“Well, read the first word of this riddle. Amazing is the first word. Its letters m, a, z spell most of the word maze. My guess is the letters reveal that we are looking for a maze|"Lizard bites are very common," Guitierrez said. "Animal handlers in zoos get bitten all the time. And just the other day I heard that a lizard had bitten an infant in her Crib in Amaloya, about sixty miles from where you were. So bites do occur. I'm not sure why your daughter had so many bites|He didn’t know why he hadn’t thought of it sooner.  He was making a mistake, trying to do it all on his own.  He needed help.  He should have made Nicholas drive him to the closest police station when they’d left the house.  Now he’d fix that mistake.
“Make a right at the next intersection,” he told Nicholas|Her briefcase fell open and he was looking down the barrel of her gun.  “Ninety-ninth, please,” she said again.
He nodded slowly, and reached for his key as if he was going to comply.  Then he lunged for the alarm button.
As if she wouldn’t have anticipated this.  A swift kick sent his arm away from the button|Aidan came to take her in, and after two glasses of wine, she was glad for a strong arm to lean on. She had much to think about. If Aidan truly loved her and wanted her to stay, would she? Would she have to give up everything else-her career, her mother, her friends? Fiona almost made it sound as if she wouldn't have a choice in the matter, but she wasn't about to abandon her independence, not even for Aidan|He was a Latino man in his mid-twenties, dirty from his day’s toil in the shipyard. He was looking none too happy to see Bill and they were engaging in a heated conversation.   
Pictures were being flashed by the detectives with a telephoto lens, hopefully they would be able to identify this character. They watched almost in disbelief as the conversation continued. This could just be a patient of Dr. Riley or an old acquaintance, but the detectives didn’t think so,  as they watched intently|My mom and Lou are right downstairs. I haven't told her about Caleb. I wanted to. To be honest, I've been stalling because the last thing I want to do is upset her when she's still trying to figure things out with my dad and Lou.

It's time I confess to my mom the truth about me and Caleb|"I have every right to sit here should I choose to do so," she returned formally. She held out her bag of popcorn. "Here," she said.

He frowned. "I beg your pardon?"

"I'm offering you some of my popcorn."

"What makes you think I want your popcorn|She dropped them quickly letting them thud on the bed on either side of her. 
Wade continued to pace, tapping his fingers on his chin. His brow knitted in deep concentration, judging her response. “What do you want? Do you need money?”
“You know that Rhett left me plenty of money.” Tears began to run down her cheeks as she began to speak, losing her breath, “I need you, Wade|A B-25 sits near completion on a desk. Only the wings and the ball turret remain to be affixed.

He smells the glue.

A bevy of Little League trophies lines the top of a dresser, each golden plastic boy facing the bed, frozen in midswing. Luther reads the engraving on the base of one of the trophies|The Shadow President had once confided to Duke that you couldn’t entertain these types of vanities, lest you run the risk of creating yet another Artist Formerly Known as Prince Rogers Nelson, or an obnoxiously fickle Sean “Puffy” Puff Daddy” “P-Diddy” Combs.
“You ask me,” the Shadow President had said, “We all ought to refuse to indulge that kind of foolishness.”
“Will do, sir,” said Duke|"Stay," he ordered, and then climbed out of the Jeep with an agility that made her envious. She watched him jog around the front of the car and then come to her side, opening the door. Extending an arm, he wiggled his fingers playfully.

Taking his hand, she let him pull her from the Jeep|Tess was intrigued by the idea of Nick Ramirez needing her for something personal.

'You know, I've actually missed you while you've been away,' he added, and she could hear him smiling through the words, the dry mocking smile he attached to any expression of emotion. 'I look forward to being with you, Tess|After I'd introduced the two vampires to the two part-demons, they took seats at the kitchen table and Pam said, "I feel that I've interrupted you when you were talking about something important."

"Yes," I said, "but I'm glad you're here. Maybe you can think of a good solution for this situation." After all, if anyone was good at disposing of humans or bodies, it was Pam|"We need to discuss, Amaryllis," said Holly, her voice even. "To decide whether we're going with you." 
Amaryllis was evidently surprised, but she agreed to it as once. The five of us huddled. 
"Shouldn't we get those two in?" asked Kae.
"Keep your voice down," whispered Holly|But he couldn’t see any lights on his head. No torches or give away green patches that night vision goggles gave off. 
It was pretty dark in this room. If Logan kept to the shadows he would be able to dash from one cubicle to the next and manage to stay undetected. He waited. Timed it just right and bolted to the next cubicle|"You don't know everything, you prick! They don't need better flowers, better food. They're dying because you've imprisoned them, Thorn. The Whispers are begging for help. They're dreameaters and they've filled the world with their plea. They're begging to be freed!"
"Of course they're dreameaters," said Thorn|But then...but then...there was water between us," said Twitchtip.

"What does that mean? There was water between us?" Gregor said.

"It means...I still smelled them. But there was water between us. Many feet of it. Their scent was getting fainter. And that's when the serpent hit my nose and everything went dark," said Twitchtip|The group followed the bear’s tracks along the sand, which led into the shrubs along the edge of the woods.
“He’s probably in the woods somewhere,” Matt said.
“If we’re really quiet, maybe we can find him,” Ava whispered.
Kacey shook her head, “I don’t think that’s such a good idea, Ava|"If it was a servant of the Prince, then Selena should have sensed its presence, just as you did with the zombies," he pointed out. "Besides, she had been the Chalice for a very long time and grown incredibly powerful. I cannot imagine even the elder wizard would dare to challenge her."

She gave a slow nod. "I think you're right, which means we're still no closer to discovering what happened to Selena|"I made it for you." She rolled the paper up again and slid it through the narrow opening in the glass. I took it, but I didn't say a word.

"Doesn't our home look like a castle in my picture?" she asked me. "I always thought it looked like a castle|*
Arriving at the palace steps, Ella glanced back once, contemplating the strange conveyance speeding away with a dragon’s roar. She could not fathom a carriage that did not require horses to pull it and Leona's assurance that a Mustang, with a 351 Cleveland engine contained more than enough horsepower, did little to clarify things. Steeling up her courage, Ella sashayed past the gaping guardsmen and into the palace|"Sam just told me to tell you that the most important thing is to not do what you did to them on the episode."

"That won't happen," I replied, "because I doubt they'll leave the keys in the car again. Wish me luck."

She did, but I didn't feel lucky|Once she reached Macklin's door, she gave it a good, sharp rap. 
"Won't Macklin be surprised!" she chuckled, and Fluffy giggled and hissed. 
There was a faint sound of voices coming from within, but the  door remained closed. 
"I wonder if he's with a client," said Gladys. 
Fluffy snapped his jaws as if to say, What's a client|“This is very good,” Sara said after she swallowed.
Adelpha smiled wide. “They are, aren’t they? I also love the hermit crabs,” she said as she reached deep in the tank and picked up a shell from the bottom, extracting a small crab and popping it whole into her mouth. She threw the empty shell back into the tank|Sitting next to him holding his hand was Jaden with his dark blonde curls, who was the cutest little thing. Sebastian saw me, smiled and waved and leaned down to say something to Jaden.

Jaden sized me up as they stood and I walked toward them. I smiled at them, trying to look much calmer than I felt inside.

Sebastian kissed me on the cheek and turned to Jaden|Not the pretty letter she meant for her priest, but her real thoughts, her account of her time here."

"You have a journal?" Marley was stunned. Why did Anna have something like that?

"Of sorts. Can you read French?"

"Yes." It made sense the letters would be in French|Shock shielded Hope from that news, insulating her from the fear she knew would settle in at any moment. "You think he saw Rory?"

"It's likely."

"Do you think he was taking Jodi to wherever she is?"

"Also likely."

For a second, she wished Logan hadn't interfered. If he hadn't, maybe they would have found Rory|Everyone was upset, especially 899 (Security). I told each member to calm down. I explained our situation, as if each team member didn't already realize it, that we were only eleven military personnel. We had no way of fighting the Ebens. We did not come 40 light years to start a war with the Ebens|They might be afraid for her. But when it counted, they stood with her. He bent his head and kissed Joie right in front of them. It was that or humiliate himself with tears shimmering in his eyes. As it was, a lump threatened to choke him. "Thank you for letting me be a part of your family, Joie|“Well, actually, you paid three grand.  In any case, that’s about the smartest dog I’ve seen.  He’s smarter than most people.  And he hates the demons, man.  He can smell them half a mile away.  He probably saved my life last night.”
Sid’s face darkened at the mention of demons|I'm the guy that will be around forever.

Mrs. Rowe yanks the placeholder off the seat next to me and plops down. "Are you nervous?"

I glance at her in response and rub my hands together. It's scary how much I want this. It's even more terrifying to think what happens if I do win|He'd been so upset earlier, some of what he said didn't even make sense. I'm sure most of it had to do with anger and embarrassment. At the restaurant he told me the housekeeper is his teacher, but then he told me she got fired over his drug problem. Maybe he said she currently taught him because he didn't expect to tell me about the drugs|Kane was so good to her, and she was beginning to believe, one tiny moment at a time, that the life she was living was real-not one of Whitney's ruthless games. A part of her, as guilty and ashamed as it made her feel, had to push to see the truth.

She'd seen Kane's face when she told him she was going shopping. He'd never really answered her about the shopping|“What did you have in mind?”
“I didn’t want anything until Brenda mentioned wings. Now that’s all I can think of.”
I laughed. “How about on the way back?”
He nodded, his gaze still fixed on the road.
“Things seemed to have thawed between you and Brenda|He had cooks. She had a mother who could barely pull herself out of bed. 
“It helps to set a timer,” Micah added, winking. “Especially if you find yourself distracted by a song demanding to be written or a picture insisting on being sketched.” He set the timer and then handed her a spoon|Ana had both arms wrapped around Travis, squeezing him in a miniature bear hug. “Ladies and gentlemen. One more time, let’s hear it for our Quest winners!”
	More fireworks exploded in the sky above them, and the crowd responded with a final ovation. 
	“I can’t believe we won,” Dizzy shouted over the fireworks|You break breeding rules, you no breed any more.”
“You think you get Kari at breeding?”
“Who knows? That’s the whole point. You gotta tell NOY you wanna breed to give yourself, not for fun. Not to make kid with the girl you like.”
“You make kid every time you breed|Orwell shook their hands also and then the Frenchmen turned and walked toward the street, away from the ship.  Adrian watched them go and saw that they turned into a small pub that had a candle in the window.
“Come on Orwell, our task is done.”  Adrian turned and walked back toward the dock with a sort of sadness hanging over him.  He did not fully understand what he felt, but he realized that he was sad|“Since I’m already in the chair, can I pilot the robot to the moon?” requested Joseph.
Sharianna was quick to interject: “Hey, I’ve been in the chair the whole time and I haven’t had the chance to fly it.”
Dad intervened, “You can both have a turn, but then I will take over when we get closer to the moon|Even the National Trust don’t want that ruin. Besides, the coach don’t stop there but twelve miles away in town.” He got up, lurched his way forward to the driver, and spoke to him, glancing back at us.
“Uh oh, Ned,” I murmured. “I don’t think they like that we’re on the coach|Using the same frequency as cell phone towers means we can track the client's signal and estimate a GPS location."

"That's genius." Why hadn't she thought of anything this remarkable? "I'm serious. This adds a vital layer of protection for your clients. One more reason people should hire bodyguards from Soren Security instead of the competition|“To hurt me.”
“I think you’re a little over-emotional about these roses.” I put my hand on her arm. “Don’t get upset. I’m not trying to be cruel, but you’re taking your grief out on Fred. You’re acting as if your daughter’s soul is living in the roses|When you remove and replace a light bulb in the Temple, the removed light bulb ceases to be part of the place.  It’s no longer holy.  The new light bulb becomes holy.

He felt the bed dip slightly as she replied, "I think it will be difficult to mate if you don't touch me, Liam."

"No mating." Liam clenched his jaw and tightened his fists. "I would think your first experience would have been enough to convince you that you don't want me for a mate|“‘Well, it doesn’t taste like what you get at the Garden Spot.’
“‘This is a steak house.  Steaks and burgers are our specialty.  The soup is just something that’s supposed to go on the side with your meal.’
“‘I would like a refund on the meal.’
“‘I can’t do that,’ said the waitress|The one thing Fang couldn't stomach was to see a woman threatened, never mind harmed.

Any creature cowardly enough to prey on a woman deserved the most brutal death imaginable. And if it was delivered to him by Fang's hand, then all the better.

Shrugging his jacket on, he picked up his plate and returned to eating|I was comfortable with my classes and the work that each professor assigned ... and Kane had been right about Professor Hanson. After that first class, more than half the people in attendance dropped her class and she was a lot friendlier and less stern than she had presented herself to be originally.

Jessi and Landon were still spending every ounce of free time they had together, which in turn, left me spending a lot more of my time with Kane|Kevin had said, offended.
Like Joshua, Kevin played bass in TUA and was more focused on music, girls, and sports than school. Kevin was a happy-go-lucky kind of guy, and though he could sometimes be immature and thoughtless, he was fun to be around.
“You have no idea,” Elizabeth answered and looked straight at Kevin|I could really join the department and be one of the good guys.  I could really have a reason to get up in the morning, do something meaningful with my life.”  Were her eyes getting a little misty?  She would not let herself cry in front of Corey Stone!
“I think I know why you came back,” said Corey|Stacie closed the door firmly and used the key to lock it.  She put the key in the porch mailbox as Mr. Holmes had requested.
When she banged the lid of the mailbox closed, all the plaster dropped from the three holes inside the house.
“What's wrong?” asked Mona, seeing Stacie frown.
“I thought I heard something inside,” said Stacie|Jordan and the female wolf were rolling in combat, and Julia felt herself torn with the desire to help. She had to do something to help Dee. To help Damien.

Julia looked at the bonfire, and before the idea was even fully formed in her mind, she was rising and letting the blanket fall from her shoulders. She whipped it around as she took the few steps toward the bonfire|I really do not want to have to talk on this subject further.  I suggest you go back to your dormitory.  I think you need time to reflect on what I have said to you.”
Pip felt his every move was as if through thick treacle, his hearing tuned to nothing.  Slowly he left the study, mouth dry and, like an automaton, headed to the dormitory|He is good with numbers and knows how to manage slaves and make decisions. I only ask for the house in Athens for myself, so that I may be close to the Academy.”
"I have heard from Plato that you are a good student. He is impressed with your accomplishments and eagerness. You have learned much, my son, but there is still much more about life that you must know, life outside of the Academy|What can I do for you?”
Julia cleared her throat, nervous. “It’s about Barbara Adams’s death.”
At that, Templeton’s smile disappeared. She shifted the bag of groceries from one arm to the other. “What about it?”
“As you know, my mother was close to Barbara|Hearing JJ talk made her understand all the more just how average she and Tony were.  Growing up, Jackie always liked being in charge.  She felt like a leader, someone cutting edge, important.  But she was just a regular person, no more, no less.  If anyone in the family was destined for something special, it was JJ|They hung like the watches on the inside of an illegal street peddler's coat.

"Something very strange is going on, isn't it?" I finally asked.

"Yes, lad," Grandpa Smedry said, still arranging the spectacles.

"We're really going to go sneak into a library?"

Grandpa Smedry nodded.

"Only, it's not really a library|“You ask me,” the Shadow President had said, “We all ought to refuse to indulge that kind of foolishness.”
“Will do, sir,” said Duke.  
“You talking to me or the little flashback about me not using Gary’s new name?”
“Uh, both, sir,” said Duke|When it was time for us to get into the water, Emmy climbed in with the rest of us.  Still wearing glasses. Come to think of it, I never saw her without them.  She didn’t wear contacts like most kids.  Maybe she was almost blind?  
It took about fifteen minutes for Miss Gardner to notice the glasses|I'm not sure whether I should feel impressed that he remembers it all, or guilty that I made him sit through so much. I tilt my head, waiting. Most girls would say something here. A gorgeous man is offering something pretty amazing, and I'm just waiting to see what else he wants to say.

Licking his lips, he seems comfortable with the knowledge that he hasn't given me something I need to respond to yet|He knew exactly where they were and proceeded to head in that direction.
Traffic was pretty light for a Saturday evening.  He made it to the coffee shop in fifteen minutes.  There were several cars parked out front.  The Guardian scanned the area.  The cafe's lights were dimmed.  He didn't notice anyone else heading towards the cafe|But is that too much to pay for your son's safety and happiness? Consider our offer, Mr. Marlowe. Talk to your son. Get him to see reason before it's too late."

With that, Mikhail saunters off into the night.

Mr. Marlowe walks silently with me back into the ship. Once we're alone again, I say, "You mustn't listen to Mikhail|The State felt their witnesses had covered what Mrs. Motter had testified to without asking her more questions.
Theodore Wilson II was seated at his table and conferring with Arnold Kukec and Jeffrey Motter. The judge had asked for him to call his next witness and he answered, “May we just have a moment, Your Honor?”
After a short conversation Mr. Wilson stated he had no more witnesses|But very much alive."

Kyle was getting the message. But seven years and fifteen-

"And the blond boy?" Ben continued as his eyes stayed locked on Kyle. "Turned out that guy wasn't his father. The boy had been taken twelve years before. Stolen right out of a hospital in D.C." He exhaled slowly and never looked away from Kyle|“But it’s not chocolate.”
“No.  Is this an allergy or something?  Because I can’t guarantee that the spoons they use haven’t come into contact with chocolate or anything.  Your throat’s not gonna swell up, is it?”
“No, it’s not an allergy|But then he seemed to soften and add, almost as an afterthought, "But with just a little more thought on your own, this could be developed by your people."
"Where are you from?" Harry asked.  "Which distant star or planet do you call home?"
The creature smiled again, "This is home|We're almost back to our hotel, so I fish my wallet from my pocket and slide out a few bills for the driver. Digging my cell phone out next, a string of texts light up the screen. They are from Colton-from several hours ago. I read each one in quick succession.

I thought Tatianna was with you in Paris.

What's going on man?

I hadn't thought to tell him that I was taking Mia in place of Tatianna|"I'm becoming quite reflective as I get older, and I just realized that love and loss share some of the same stages. You are definitely in denial."

"I'm not in love," Rachid said curtly.

Dominic laughed. "Famous last words. Come on, let's go see your father. I have a honeymoon to return to."

As they walked, Rachid said, "You're wrong this time, Dominic|Even as agents were scrambling, the FAA would be faxing a passenger manifest to the central command post.

The president stared at him, nodded, and reached for the phone. In seconds he had Jerry Matthews, the head of the FBI, on the line, and was explaining what had to be done.

"I don't have time to give you all the details right now, Jerry|She had watched him, this entire time, as he recorded every detail of the keep, charted every flaw, every issue while refusing to fix even the smallest latch. 
He had been cataloguing for an attack.
The chapel was suddenly before her, and she reined in hard, spinning to a stop. Leland and Eli were before her in a moment, still in their leather gear, their eyes seeking to hers in surprise.
“Eli, get to the keep,” she ordered as she leapt off her horse, moving toward the chapel|“What’s your business here?”
“We’re looking for a girl. Gold hair, green eyes. She’s young, twenty-one maybe. Has a tattoo on the back of her neck. Seen her?”
Neither Yana nor Tucker answer right away. They’re probably feigning bewilderment. “No, I haven’t seen anyone I don’t already know,” says Yana|"Cori, can I get you a soda or something?" Ashe's mother asked.

"A soda would be nice. Do you have more orange?" Cori wiped the last of her tears with the heel of a hand.

"I do." Adele pulled two bottles from the fridge and handed one to Cori and the other to Ashe|I call in advance and they take it down and put it in the water for me.”
Bev and Emily watched as a forklift picked up a boat from the fourth tier of the storage facility and lowered it to the ground where a dock worker hooked it up to a truck and pulled it around to the boat ramp. Emily said, “That is way cool, although I don't think I could watch them do that if it was my boat|But I needed to do something first. It was time for some vengeance. "Mia must too, since you guys let her hang out with you. She's not royal."

His finger playfully poked me in the calf. "She's with Aaron. And I've got lots of friends who aren't royal|Raine had described it to Cliff and Lynn remembered the story she had read on the doctor’s notes about the funnel made of toiletries that had floated around Raine’s bathroom.  Cliff had thought they were an hallucination.  
Remembering something else she’d read in those notes, she whirled to look into the shower stall.  There it was, just as it was written|I think it just matters what we do with them.”
“That’s kind of a cop-out, isn’t it?”
Dormer smiled. “Perhaps.”
They sat there in silence, looking at the blue lights dance across the pond.
“Listen,” said Colton. “Not to shatter the calm or anything, but—”
“We need to get started,” interrupted Dormer|My hands fist into the front of his shirt so I can keep standing as his taste and the feel of his hands tangling into my hair cause my legs to go weak.

"You guys have a whole house. Do you have to do that in the middle of the kitchen?" Brandon says, breaking the moment.

Mike pulls his mouth from mine then smiles, looking over at Brandon|Come over here and I’ll show you the other reason.”
Gloria and Rick followed Bill O’Hara into his garage and showed them an old Cadillac that looked alright except that it needed paint.
“I’m going to restore this and there’s not room enough in the garage for both of them.”
“It must be a fun way to spend your time,” said Gloria|At least Emma had survived the transformation. He feared Caitlyn wouldn't. The guilt would be too much to bear.

As Angus climbed the stairs, his eyes glimmered with emotion. "I'll always be there for her now."

Carlos lowered his voice. "I need to talk to you about Caitlyn|The marines could perceive the young people to be friendly (the marines themselves were only 19-year-olds), but, at a distance of about 30 yards, it was as if a warning shot rang out—some of the marines made as if to reach for their weapons.  Mills started from the midst of the group—dark spots under his arms marked where the perspiration had soaked into his shirt.
"None of us know how we got here," Ray explained, taking on a leadership role.  He had, after all, saved John Henry's life, so, although he was younger than John Henry, he had a certain serendipitous good fortune going for him which plucked him out to be leader|I’m not your lab rat. But she bit her tongue, trying to keep things polite.
She wished she could be with Kerim and Gabriel instead of being stuck at the GN office. Harry had sent them on missions in Haifa and Gaza to meet with other Truth Seekers.
“I want to go with them to meet the others,” she told Harry|The mysterious lady was dead right – Get out of here for a while and take a break. Between your grandfather’s constant political events, what to do about Ben and your terrible job, I’m surprised you’re still upright.”
Abby could see Sarah struggling.  Her eyes were misty and she chewed on her lip.
“…Um…”
“Don’t think, Sarah|He didn't know any Currans and besides, the card had come from whoever was in the only other occupied cabin on that deck.

So he waited.

"2A is..." Teresa's voice trailed off and Nick watched as his usually unflappable assistant chewed at her bottom lip.

That couldn't be good.

"What is it?" When she didn't answer right away, he demanded, "Just tell me who's in the other cabin|She entered Pieter's bedroom and sat at the table with all of the broadcasting equipment. Jackie quickly found the main transmission radio. On the digital clock she noticed that it was already well after mid day. Jackie typed on the wireless keyboard the frequency that Pieter had provided her earlier that morning. She pushed the send button and talked in the microphone: “Come in, Pieter|Shamira answered the door, took the note and the boy ran back.

Shamira read the note to Guilietta. "Master della Cappa requires another looker brought to the palace immediately. That's all it says."
"Things must be going well at the meeting if they need another sample," Guilietta said, smiling.
"I guess," Shamira said, staring at the note|****
THE WOODS
Officer Braxton and his partner Officer White receive the call around 5: a.m. and are warned about the possibility of rabid squirrels on the Zimmermann property, 25 Cool Spring Drive; they chuckle, imagining a manic squirrel roaming the woods. “I bet it has yellow eyes …I wonder if it talks?”  
They aren’t in any hurry and even stop last minute at Stan’s Diner for some coffee and pancakes; neither one is prepared for the carnage they find an hour later in the woods|"Yes, more penguins, please." I want to release some of the tension, so I do a little penguin walk after I put the plates down. I'm rewarded with a whoop of laughter from Jett and then I hear a groan from Hazel's room. Jett clamps his mouth shut and I stop acting like a penguin|Behind him, closer to the palace, was a hedge maze and a rose garden that filled the air with amazing scents.

Despite the fact that Griffin wasn't a big fan of horses, he felt more comfortable out here than he did inside the castle. There was too much protocol there. Too much formality. Out here, there was too much time to think-but given a choice...

"Since when do you like horses|What a sweet little gnome.

"It shall mean something," Kelexel said. "You are very attractive to me. We Chem are kind to those who please us. You cannot go back to your friends, of course, not ever. There are compensations, however. It's considered an honor to serve the Chem|He scowled at me. “My life is not an open book for your enjoyment.”
“Come on.”
Silence.
“I was curious about you. I am -- I was -- acquainted with your aunt,” he said softly.
My jaw dropped open.
“What do you mean, ‘acquainted|The four of them looked at the fragile old woman skeptically.
“Let us take a hike on one of the beginner trails,” Ami suggested.  “It's good for my old bones to get out and about and these mineral springs are wonderfully rejuvenating.”
They did as Ami suggested and took a hike|“What’s troubling you?” said Tuan.
Zoe didn’t want to talk about her problems with Yurik, so instead she told Tuan about the Russian woman and McKenzie Clark.
“So, are you going to tell your mother about it?” said Tuan.
“My mother and I don’t get along,” said Zoe|Kim's funeral is tomorrow and they're leaving for France after the funeral.  They want to get away from the press and everything for a few weeks," said Allison.
"Is Sophie going with them?" asked Katrina.
"Yes, they don't want her to be alone.  They've already withdrawn her from State," said Allison|The funeral was as sad as Myka had thought it would be. But she was glad she had the chance to say a good-bye to her friend, the fun-loving young woman who'd lived hard and died too quickly.

Afterward, Myka drove back to Spike's house. His Shifter neighbors up and down the street watched her return, knowing something had changed between her and Spike|Yanking back a fistful of the thief's hair and sinking her teeth into an unprotected throat. It was a strange, unsettling vision, but for a moment it almost seemed real.

She became aware that Bonnie and Meredith were looking at her.

"Well?" she said, feeling slightly uncomfortable.

"I could tell you weren't listening," sighed Bonnie|They come after me in droves! Masses of them!"
"I see," said Macklin.
"You get to choose when you go into the acolyte business," said Polydoor. "It's either a monk's cowl or a big mole." 
"You made a wise choice," said Macklin|I grinned, “This is going to be some fun revenge!”
“You can say that again.”
“Okay,” I said, “this is going to be some fun revenge.”
She wacked me in the head with my pillow, “You’re so weird.”
“Well that’s the way I am, deal with it,” I wacked her back with my own pillow|Each battle of persuasion is attempting to push their counterpart over to their verdict. I wonder amidst all this hostility what could cause them all to feel so violent. I think,
 “What could cause a man to act so hateful towards another?” 
The approaching pounding is very close now. I notice in my blindness something particularly odd. An eerie awkward silence seems to parallel the point nearest the sound of the pounding|she asked warily, steering the conversation back to her main concern. It wasn't like her to be sidetracked by a good-looking man-which made this one all the more dangerous.

"A friend of mine sent me here. He attended one of your dance classes last year. Your name is too unique for me to be mistaken|I'm glad I happened along."

She tried to extract her hand, but he held it captive as he smiled down at her. "Not so fast. I still don't know your name."

"Elle Masterson." The continued physical contact jacked up her heart rate.

"Nice to meet you at last, Elle|The silence was never stealthy, as if concealing danger like now.

"Wh---" Misty was suddenly thrust behind Domenico just before he shifted and took the bullet that was meant for her. "Domenico!" But already his body was pushing the bullet out, the wound healing. He snarled, and she whirled around just in time to see men half-crawling, half-running towards them until they formed a threatening circle around her and Domenico|"It can be done," Maggie Walsh said, "but only if the person or persons are in the presence of the Deity. The Deity would have to lead him--or them--across; otherwise they'd sink and drown."

Ignatz Thugg said, "Maybe Mr. Russell is the Deity." To Russell he said, "Are you a Manifestation of the Deity|Beatrice and Claire had both accepted Francis's invitation, as had Lady Genevieve and Lady Giddington, while Lord Camden had joined them a couple of days later.

Emily soon realized that her preconceptions regarding Claire's fiance had been unfounded. He clearly worshiped the ground that Claire walked upon, and was eager to do whatever he could to please her. Claire, on the other hand, looked radiant with love, and would (to Beatrice's growing exasperation) continuously find ways in which to be alone with her fiance|"This is hardly the time or place for experimentation."

"He'll do just fine. Walk him through it a time or two until he gets the hang of it."

"Exactly what is it I'm supposed to do?" Garion asked apprehensively.

Aunt Pol gave Belgarath a hard look and then turned to Garion|She rose reluctantly and held out a hand to Niki.

"Card," she said brusquely.

Niki hastily opened the leather briefcase and took out a gold card holder. She extracted a business card and placed it in Cassidy's outstretched palm.

Cassidy handed the card to Raine. "I want you to think about this, Raine|You couldn't let me die."

I wanted to wipe that self-confident smirk off her face, but I knew it was true. The idea of watching her die didn't sit well with me. Why? She's the original vampire's daughter. She's most likely made of pure wickedness. Why wouldn't I want to see her die|Until she saw the shapes of unicorns and dragons in the clouds, no one saw anything but cloud. She wore a piece of jade around her neck, which she had found and fashioned herself; before then, no one had ever made jewelry. She discovered salt on a breezy afternoon, discovered pepper over a long weekend. Had there been weaving, she would have woven|“Before now?” Jason asked, dropping Emma’s hand and leaning back in his chair. “No, I don’t know anyone who has. They’re just legends. But if this bracelet is one of them than it must be very powerful.” 
Emma heard a hint of awe in Jason’s voice as he talked about the bracelet|A moment later I heard, “Hi, Daddy.”
Leland responded to his son’s greeting with a warm “Hey buddy. Come sit here.” A second shadow danced on the back of the tent in the flickering light of a lantern.
“What’cha doing, Daddy?”
“Major Squires and I are discussing a little business,” replied Leland|Not sure if this was a trick question, and what the right answer should be, I responded, “No.”
I was afraid that when he asked me to get out of the car, he would see the joint, or smell the smoke drifting up. Very nonchalantly, I looked down to try to find the joint|When my two feet hit the ground, I look around and see the first two riders, now on the ground like us. That first girl—the one who fell off—she’s not crying any more, and the second girl is really smiling, just like me.
I look back at Rei and she’s dusting herself off like she’s an ekspert caballo rider|I know you think you want to be here, but it's wrong. You need to come home."

"No, Eugenie. I'm saying what you should have been saying all along. I recognized my birthright, and I came for it. Whereas you..." She shook her head, anger kindling in her words. The intensity of that hate seemed absurd with her young, high voice - as did the fact that she'd actually used the word "birthright|You know, the Amish Rifle.”
“Ohio State Billy Harper? The guy who led the comeback against Michigan like a hundred years ago?”
Billy tried to change the station, but Dana grabbed his hand, suddenly interested.
“The one and only,” Hawk continued. Billy could feel him smirking right through the radio|You called him, right?"

Jordan turned to face me and shook her head before she turned back. "Nina, what do you mean? Your father..."

I moved around her and touched Nina's hand. "Baby, I'm so happy you're back."

Nina stared up at me with a vacant look and then looked at Jordan|The girls all stopped what they were doing, which had been preparing-in various states of distress or, in Sophronia's case, delight-to try their own versions of the somersault, and began patting about for handkerchiefs.

"What did I tell you yesterday? A lady always has her handkerchief on her person. A handkerchief is endlessly useful. Not only is it a communication device, but it can also be dropped as a distraction, scented with various perfumes and noxious gases for discombobulation, used to wipe the forehead of a gentleman, or even bandage a wound, and, of course, you may dab at the eyes or nose if it is still clean|she finally asked him curiously.

"She was caught off guard by you, so ... I managed to hit her over the head with a brass candlestick before she had the chance to fire a second shot."

Emily's hands flew to her mouth to stop the sudden onset of laughter. "You hit your mother over the head with a candlestick|I ran straight for him and he came right at me. He tried to overpower me but I used some finesse and just took off his head. It felt very fulfilling.
The streets were empty as I ran through the town but that was short-lived as werewolves started coming out of everywhere, and I literally mean everywhere. It seemed like the whole town was full of werewolves|"Be a little more aggressive," she encouraged. "Give it a little more."

I pulled harder and the shoulders started appearing, then the belly, and finally the entire calf spilled out and into my lap. I'd never experienced anything like that before and it was incredibly exhilarating. I smiled down at the baby but it wasn't breathing|Having risen to her feet, the manager of the Blue Emerald brushed herself down, shook her head clear, and walked purposely over to the bandit with the silver beard, all before anyone could stop her. 
She stood in front of him and declared, "I am the manager of this resort, and I demand to know what you are doing here? And I insist that we give medical help to the security guard that you have injured|For a brief moment, he thought about himself, in his grad school days, before that building had buried him and started him on his own journey of vengeance.

Janus walked to the wall. A panel opened as he approached. He took out another yellow cube and began working his fingers in the light that emerged around it.

He returned to Milo and handed him the cube|“Only that the information is coming from Memphis Naval Air Station and is being acquired and sold by an information broker; a Canadian that my brother said was called The Dutchman,” she said.
“How international. There are a lot of Canadians around here. I think the waiter forgot about us.” Tony said trying to change the subject but realized Natasha was looking at him expectantly. “Your secret is safe with me, Natasha|Jones looked over at the jury as if to urge it on to get all of this, really.
“Given all this,” continued Brent, “it is no wonder that people will listen, and believe, when she outlines and promises them heaven here on earth.”
“Is that really what she promises?” said Jones.
“The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation,” said Brent|He handed the phone over to Samantha.

"I see Blake's being his usual talkative self," Erica mused down the line. She didn't wait for Samantha to agree. "I heard about your accident and just wanted to see how you were doing."

Samantha appreciated her concern. "I'm fine, thanks, Erica|"Child, young man, good day. Hunter ... " she paused. Then she ran one clawlike finger along the line of Hunter's jaw. "Hunter, you are always welcome here." She nodded to them, imperiously, and stood up and walked away, followed by her wasp-waisted butler.

"We should leave now," said Hunter|You were right about Damon being in Fell's Church."

"I know. He did this to you, didn't he?" Elena didn't mention that she'd gone searching for him. "I - don't remember. But he's dangerous. Keep Bonnie and Meredith with you tonight, Elena|He ripped off his boots and socks, leaving them scattered over the meadow.

She slipped off her socks, then neatly rolled them and stashed them in her boots. "It's just a different culture here. In the western world, men have learned to be more sensitive to a woman's needs." She perched her hat on top of her boots|"It was good." I shook my head. "Really, really, good. The best. But it shouldn't have happened. I have too much going on to deal with that too! I mean, I'm not interested in a fling."

"What makes you think it would be a fling|I'm not going to prom."

"Who cares? Hey, Maggie, Wendy!" Angela calls across the department store to Wendy, who's in the shoe department with my mom looking through the clearance heels. "Come see this dress for Clara."

They drop everything and come to see the dress|"Ugh, I hate those sonic booms and the ground vibrations! How many does this make? I'm losing count now. These huge spheres are only shuttles to them. They seem to be moving about 10,000 at a time into the towers."
"I think this makes 10," Nisha said. "This means 100,000 of them have moved into the towers|“What more did you want to talk to me about, Lapo?” she heard the baron say. “I really must be getting home.”
“The Cup, is it real?” Lapo asked. “Is it something physical, or metaphorical?”
“I don’t know; I haven’t got a clue, Lapo|The moonlight also fell on Myka's purse, and the blue of the envelope sticking out of it. Myka carefully slid out from under Spike's arm, took the two steps across the room, fetched the letter, opened it, moved to the moonlight, and started to read.

Jillian's voice came to her across the divide.

I hope that while you're reading this, Myka, you're with Spike|That's what Beck told me." Sam pulled his arms free and leaned on the railing instead. He eyed me. "Are you cold?"

It took me a moment to realize the implication: Will you shift?

But I felt good, real, firmly me. I shook my head and joined him at the railing|In fact, they went to Atlanta to see the different types of carriages so they could settle on the type they will be using. I’m sorry.”
Wade nodded, understanding, and replied, “Thank you for your time.” He rose to leave.
Mr. Johnson stopped him, “Please sit down, Wade|We already know she has one of them defending her."

Dimity looked nervous. "Are you sure we should be involving ourselves? Isn't this something for the adults to sort out?"

Sophronia gave an evil little grin. "I'm thinking of it as training. Besides, if the prototype is at my house, I am involved|I didn’t want to push her since we had our pasts to catch up on.  
“I knew one day it would find you.”  She gazed at me while running her fingers through my hair.  “The amulet had a connection to me and I knew when you had it.  I was overjoyed that day.”
“What was it like—I mean connected to the amulet|Going straight to the point without ceremony, Jina said, 'So, once again, you timed your meeting with Kainar well!’
‘Calm down, Jina! It was only arranged a few days ago. You were out of contact and I couldn’t call you back in time.’
‘Oh, yes? Or was it just very convenient?’
‘Don’t you believe me, Jina|Gregor was clutching the mirror so tightly it hurt his hands. The mirror! He thought of the hours he'd spent before the bathroom mirror, holding up the prophecy, trying to make sense of it. "The mirror!" he said holding it up urgently for them to see. "You know how you need a mirror to read the prophecy|“And I’m not contesting anything. Just a little worried, that’s all. A mother’s prerogative,” she added.
“Have you settled on which book to recommend?” said Ananda.
“Rosenberg’s Breath by Breath may be the most accessible,” she answered.
“And there is Buddhadasa Bhikkhu’s Mindfulness with Breathing,” said Ananda|He had to force himself to stare at anything but her hands. Her beautiful hands. So gentle. So feminine. Capable of delivering the most undeniable pleasure, he was sure. "I farm."

Her mouth formed a large O as her gaze swept over him. "You don't look like a farmer|Here you go.”  He handed the man two coins.  One remained.
The man handed us the two tickets.
“Thank you.  Can you tell me what I can buy with what’s left?” Theen held up the remaining coin.
“Not much.”
We wandered around the town looking for food that we could buy with the last coin|Gary had taken an extended coffee break, though as visibly upset as he was, I was not about to complain. Finally, Pia had taken Maya away to review some cost issues. Unless I wanted to await the arrival of Giorgio and Fiona, it was down to me to begin storing the artwork in the warehouse, the one place I had particularly wanted to avoid.
Gearing myself up, I picked up the first painting I saw and headed for the warehouse|"Did you end up finding the torch that sabotaged the ride?" Samantha inquired.
"We did," Grey responded.
"Is this the torch you found?" Samantha asked, pointing to an acetylene torch placed by the court's deputy in front of the witness stand."
"Yes," Grey said as he examined the tag that was hanging from the torch|They arrived at the bowling alley, and Daman grabbed Nadia’s hand and pulled her out of the car. She had to jog to keep up with his running to the front door. They all went inside, and Kain secured them two lanes side by side. Anabella and Nadia gathered all the shoes, and the boys picked out all of the balls|“Fran wants to talk to you.”
Rick came to the phone, “Hello my beautiful fiancé.”
“I can’t wait until we’re married so you’ll quit calling me that.”
“Sorry, sorry.  So what did Finch have to say?”
Fran gave him the run down on her conversation with Finch|Bev finally said, rather lamely, “I could use another cup of coffee, how about you?”
Peggy said, “Personally, after that, I'd like a drink. But, considering the hour and the fact that we have a day of house-hunting ahead of us, I'll take a cup of coffee, too.”
Bev put a cup of coffee in front of her mother and said, “We'll take a rain check on the drink|He doesn't seem to notice however, taking off his tie completely and setting it aside. "But only if it's okay with you."

I want to say no, but I'm distracted by the button. Pick it up. Pick it up! A sickness of mine. The need to pick up every single fallen one. "I guess so," I mumble, sliding the handle of my bag onto my shoulder, trying to ignore the compulsion to pick up the button|Selena came back to earth as the noises filtered through again. 
She watched in contentment as Matt joked with Paul and Jennifer, his charm too much for anyone to resist. She felt whole now that Matt was here, as if she could take on the world. 
Even though Paul was laughing and joking with the group, Selena noticed occasionally a sad look cross his eyes as he stared at her and Matt|‘Was it good?’
‘Yes, it was great,’ with very little emotion in his voice.
Laura could see Josh was struggling and the last thing he wanted to do was to talk to her, but she had come this far and she really needed to carry on.
‘So, how are you doing, Josh|"Where are you, still in New Orleans?"
"No!  I'm in Paris."
"Paris!  Are you kidding me?"
"No.  I flew in last night."
"First I ask you if you're in Paris and you tell me no, you're in New Orleans.  Now, I ask if you're still in New Orleans and you tell me no you're in Paris|“You sir – I respect – but I don’t think I would say fear,” Magen answered disconcertedly, “What do I fear... In one sense – nothing.”
“Nothing! How is that possible? A fearless man?” The High Marshal commented almost sarcastically.
“Is a soldier not meant to be fearless|It almost seemed as if the sun had darkened a bit and it felt as if evil was gathering up around them. Yet, the silence prevailed. No one had ever witnessed the King in this manner! Today his anger appeared to border on madness! The silence continued on for long and terribly unpleasant moments! 
Then, unexpectedly, from the shade of a small arbor, a man began to hesitantly move in the direction of the King|I look over at her, and they are gone.

THE FIRST NIGHT IT HAPPENED

The first night it happened, I followed them into the strip mall parking lot. They were all stuffed into a silver-gray Honda-all thousand of them. This was back in November. Charlie had only been dead two months then.

One minute I was sitting on the side of a country road, taking shots of Smirnoff and counting my tips before I went back to the store to close, the next minute I was in the middle of a science fiction movie, complete with a jet-powered Honda Civic and a thousand translucent zombielike beings who looked like Charlie|Finished, he dropped back down to the trail below just as things took a sudden turn. From out of the pass ahead of him, goblins came running, rounding a corner in the pass, each of them scrambling as the ground began to shake beneath them. Gnak ducked low into the shadow of the stone wall and moved as quickly as he was able to exit the pass|MIKE moves in a step closer to the chair (we can see it now, as well as the MEN), then stops as a BLOODSTAINED HAND appears. It goes to the table beside the chair and takes a cookie.

MIKE

(levels his gun) Freeze!

The hand does just that freezes in midair, holding the cookie|Afraid, too. I’m scared to death and I admit it. That is why I’m shaking, Karen. Can’t you see how I’m shaking. And I’m shaking because when I think of Bill I think that maybe we’ve done him wrong. But I have not . . . I have not lost my mind, Karen|And yet, so beautiful.

His jaw shifted beneath her hand, and she drew back, feeling her cheeks grow warm once again. Of course, I find all the Lords creations to be beautiful.

Really? His mouth curled up. Even a cockroach?

Her cheeks blazed hotter. Well, I must admit you look considerably better than a cockroach|The boys just laughed at this, while another boy shouted, “My mother says I’m the most disgusting person in all of Arria, since I take after my father!” 
A few boys nodded, agreeing with their friend, although some boys wanted to argue and challenged him to eat some worms. When he declined, they all immediately told him that he wasn’t the most disgusting person in all of Arria|I asked, looking back at her in the rearview mirror.
“I’m not so sure anymore,” she said, leaning her head against the back of the seat. She closed her eyes. “I just remember bits and pieces of last night. Watching the band, the party, meeting Slade. I don’t know… I almost feel like I’ve been drugged|But he lets go of my shoulders. Something passes between them then: some kind of shared knowledge I cannot guess at.

Are they friends, then? How can that be possible? Mikhail terrifies me, but Alec-his effect on me is something altogether different. Should I be as afraid of Alec as I am of Mikhail|“You will find out exactly what it is capable of doing.” He jerked his hand away, letting the gun fall into Evelyn’s waiting hand. He shot me a murderous glare before disappearing into thin air, reappearing behind the rogue, his hands wrapped tightly around his throat. He glanced back at us.
“Let’s go with six months staking and decapitation,” said Evelyn|Petr nodded in acknowledgement, ‘Felt like your strength was draining out through the soles of your feet?’
‘Yes that’s exactly it! I thought I was going to melt into a puddle of frightened goop on the ground.’
‘Well, my friend, you’re not alone,’ smiled Petr.
Matt finally smiled and exhaled a long unsteady breath, ‘Thanks, Petr|The hunting might be sparser, but the risk of being caught was much lower.

Nicholas had to get rid of the infestation. It was too dangerous to allow demons to live among so many people. "Give me the details. I'll take care of it."

"And the woman?"

"I can't take her into combat with me," said Nicholas|99 INTERIOR: RESUME JOANNA, IN THE SHED DOORWAY.

Here's the tarp. It's been used to cover BILLY'S body, but his feet stick out.

THE CAMERA PANS across the back of the shed|Jeremy shifted his stance and crossed his arms over his chest. "You decided to go with Bliss," he said instead of an answer.

Daddy and I had talked about baby names when he was awake and able to talk. Bliss had been his idea. I had been leaning toward Heidi. He had said that he believed my little girl was going to be my bliss|"After we got back to school and piled in our cars, I was at a stoplight. A friend of mine was next to me. I revved my engine. He revved his." He pauses. "When the light turned green, I pressed down on that pedal so hard my head jerked back. It was a rush, especially knowing I was leaving my friend in the dust|The soldier was sitting in a chair by the bed, his crutch by his side.

"Hey, Mareth, how you doing?" asked Gregor.

"I cannot complain. How are you feeling?" said Mareth.

Gregor shifted around. "Kind of sore. How long have I been asleep?"

"Some sixteen hours. They roused you once to administer the plague cure, but you never really awoke," said Mareth|"In several holos you can see the ship he's watching. It's a Tailor Scout, Class IV.

My heart sank. “How can it be wrong?” It felt perfect.

“Dresses? Oh no. I can't wear dresses, I look terrible in them. They make me look too fat,” Danika protested.
Naomi and Philip glanced at each other again, puzzled. Naomi reassured Danika, “Nobody here will think you're fat|Though there were many audio and visual warning signs to stop its movement, Seth’s attention was somewhere else. Nobody had the temerity to override Seth’s action. The sudden stop of any signals coming from Collie indicated that it would have tumbled down into the crater. As an expert space vehicle commander, Seth relayed commands to “Master” to rise from the ground. He then maneuvered Master towards the crater that he selected and made it turn around and crash onto the center of the crater|"Since they're going to be spending the next week with me flying around in a plane, it would be a good idea to remind them who I am."

She allowed herself to fall just a little more under his spell again, even if only for a minute. "That's very sweet of you."

"Sweet? First you make out with my cousin and then you call me sweet|Margaret sat down, ducking to avoid banging her head on the top bunk. The dog settled on her lap.

'Ran her up and down the gangway|“There’s a small pond over there,” said the guy, pointing to the right side of the hut.  “Go wash up and come back inside when you’re all dried up. I’ll bring you a pair of clothes as well.”    
“Thanks,” replied Charlie.    
“Meet you in a few,” said the guy, closing the door to his hut|He walked around her, rubbing against her. He picked up the extra sleeve coming out of the front of her dress and fondled it, turning it over in his hand and staring at her torso. 
She drew her arms up to try to protect herself from his eyes. She pulled back, though he hung on to the sleeve|Look at my back."
The doctor lifted her shirt and examined the bite.
"This is really inflamed. It looks like a spider bite there at the center. But, it is affecting her like a jellyfish sting. Does it look worse today than it did last night?"
"It looked like an insect bite before we left this morning, so yes|Even though he knew there was nothing more down there than a fallen tree sitting in that little lake.

“You should come,” I invited.  “Besides, you could probably get on one of the floats|Kat's mouth has opened and closed a few times, but she still hasn't said anything.

I look from her to Brandon and shake my head. "No, you're not working at the strip club. You're going to help November."

"I think we should talk about this," Kat says.

My eyes go to her and then back to Brandon|"I know." She grinned. "I'm good at this."

"If I knew that, I'd have been begging for them every time we hung out."

"I couldn't let you know. It's my best kept secret."

He chuckled. "I'll take it to the grave|Well, that's nice of her and all, but I hope we don't go up there and I find myself in the same situation as I'm in with Natalie here."

Andrew shakes his head. "Nah, Michelle's not like that." He backtracks that comment to put more emphasis on just how true it is. "Michelle is nothing like Natalie."

"That's not what I meant, Andrew|I demonstrated how inviting I could be, and his tongue swept into my mouth, making it clear that as long as I wasn't resisting, he wasn't going to hesitate to take what he wanted. I had heard that he was a force to be reckoned with in a courtroom, so it made sense he would be that way in the bedroom. Trust me, I had no problem with that. I liked forces to be reckoned with in the bedroom|In the old nights so long ago, Lestat had been a respected and highly visible gentleman, for whom tailors and shopkeepers had kept late hours, a patron of the arts, a common figure nodding to those he passed in Jackson Square or on the steps of the Cathedral. Lestat had had a lawyer who handled his affairs of the world; Lestat came and went as he chose. "These matters are nothing," said Lestat|"I imagine it could if they were bloated on a Luxen's powers."

Overwhelmed, I sat back and then shot forward. "Do you think the opal can, like, counteract the onyx?"

I ignored the sarcastic tone. "Where can we get some of the opal|She climbed back into the wagon, pulling the door closed herself.
“It’s Pan. He’s back. He’s going to Aberdeen with us.” Agnes was peering between her fingers looking at Chloe with giant eyes. “It’s okay, Agnes.”

"Well, here's the deal," I said to Violet|“Justin, whatever is the matter?”
He ran frantically down the path, but collapsed halfway down it’s length to his knees, sobbing hysterically.  I tried calling him several times, asking him what was the matter, but he could not possibly respond.  I received my answer, however, when I looked down the end of the front path|I wanted to shout myself hoarse at him, but I couldn't do it. I just wanted him gone.

Esther played with the tattered sleeve.  “It’s the only nice dress I have left,” she said sadly and then she seemed to shake herself.  She looked up, but her gaze never made it past the medals on Henrik’s chest.  “It looks like you’ve done well for yourself, Henrik|"I'll remember that."

I threw on clothes as fast as humanly possible, grabbed my keys and ran, ran, ran to the car.

He quickly knelt down and took the flowers from the plastic vase.

And without waiting to see what the man would do, Alistair strode to the inn|I screamed from the other side of the granite island in the kitchen, pounding my fist against the top.

"Because!" she shouted back.

"Because why?"

I wanted a rich and famous husband," she screamed|"Perhaps the unintelligible static that Ed and Talking Owl sense telepathically is related to the electromagnetic interference that plagues our signal devices when near Hairless Bear or the Mountain.

I gulped and tried to keep my hands from trembling. “Ashley Tinaryth.” I jerked in surprised. His hold on my hand tightened slightly. Look him in the eye, Trynnadon hissed in my head. I squeaked. Sorry, he whispered. I slowly, cautiously, tilted my head back to look up at Tristan|Whatever followed was not a handshake. It took all her willpower not to jerk her hand back. She looked around for Matt – he would embarrass her if he saw someone caressing her hand that way.

"How did you know my mother, Senator?"
He accepted wine from a passing waiter, drank from the glass in a way that was more guzzling than sipping, and said, "Please, call me Lance|The watch stopped at just that time so we can still see when the world was made – at a quarter past three on Monday afternoon 6137 years ago.

“Eh, yes certainly,” Sycko said. “I didn’t know all that. But how did you manage to find the watch|However, there was a graphic display, similar to a heart beat graph. The solid line was not wavering. Our doctors understood that meant the same thing that their equipment measured: the heart was not beating. The Ebens administered some liquid through a needle. This was done several times. Eventually, the heart started beating. 
But our doctors knew the internal organs of the body were damaged, but couldn't fully explain that to the Ebens|Some on her face. Mostly though on her arms and legs.”

Milt clasped his hands together in an attempt to catch it, but missed the bottle completely. It hit the ground and rolled away from the big man on the red potatoes.

"No, Stephanie. If you had heard them, which I did, then you'd agree with me. They can't leave there. If they do, they'll tear apart the world. We have to leave them there and hope that time brings some sense into their heads," said Phillip|Like mother, like daughter-Callum was never far from my mind and never far from hers. The difference was that I'd come to terms with the things Callum had done to set me on the path to becoming the Cedar Ridge alpha, and Ali probably never would. She'd loved Callum, the same way I had, but she'd never cared that he was the alpha|Now, though, as she stood right in front of him and actually watched a shutter come down over his eyes, effectively blocking her out, she wondered if coming here had been the right thing to do after all.

Still, she was here. And since she was, she would at least get Justice back on his feet.

"So, what's it going to be, Justice|Everything in me was screaming to pull Kash into the back and tell him exactly who Blake was to me. But I didn't want to voice those words at all, and especially not at work. I couldn't break down in front of everyone. I needed a distraction. Or to leave. Something, anything to take my mind off Blake|“Hours later, I arrived at the tower and my heart was pounding so hard that I was 
certain I would pass out at any moment. I pulled a camera from my backpack and took a few photos of the tower.

I grabbed a long coil of rope from one of the saddle bags and proceeded on foot to the rear of the tower|Greg scans the area, taking in the size of the lake.
"Now that’s a big lake," he says, with the excitement of a true fisherman. He strolls over to the dock and checks out the area as the others get their hunting gear ready.
"Here you go," Bob says, tossing the keys to Greg|In the middle of the crowded station packed with travelers returning from their Easter trips, I stopped. There was no way I could not hug him. I had a feeling that would be happening a lot.
It felt surreal when he walked into my apartment with me, like the walls who had seen me cry over him so many times were staring. I felt the urge to say, “Yes, this is really him,” to both the walls and myself|“I see you’ve found Wolf and Captain Gilbride.”
“It was kind of you to invite them down,” Evie said politely. “What luck that you ran into them at your club.”
A puzzled frown creased Matt’s pleasant, round face. “Seemed more like Wolf hunting me down, actually|I also was noticing that breathing was actually rather uncomfortable.

"Who hit me?" I gave a silent prayer that it wasn't Robbie. That it was just someone who looked kind of like Robbie|She watched his jaw grow tighter and tighter.

Does he blame himself for the countess's actions?

How could he not?

Rhun finally closed the book, his face lost and defeated. "Once she was not evil. She was full of sunlight and goodness."

Erin questioned how much of that was true, wondering if love blinded Rhun to the true nature of the countess|Summer stood next to me in the line-up, a grimly determined expression on her face. I think it was the first time she realized we were all against her.

Today, instead of a three day reprieve between challenges, we'd been called out for yet another one. Everyone looked unhappy.

Well, everyone except me. I'd done my best to lag behind in the last challenge|"And my own humble fiefdom is only minutes away from you in the Alps."

"Seth and Fareed," I said. "You are our physicians, our scientists, our bold explorers. What can I do? What can all of us do to support you in your ongoing work?"

"Well, I think you know," said Seth|He had seen standing stones before, monoliths arranged in a ring, or a line, rising up from lonely fields, often far from cities and towns. There was definitely something mystical about them, a timeless power and despite his misgivings he found himself excited by the prospect of such a spectacle appearing suddenly within a field or meadow.
Somewhere ahead, Dredger too thought of the stones|a girl wearing a terry-cloth Lacoste dress and grosgrain-ribbon flip-flops whispered to her friend, who had on an equally short sundress and sky-high wedge heels. "He told me."

Lacoste Dress rolled her eyes. "Of course he's playing in the tournament|"There are so many of them, and some of the lines are rather long." I turned my head to study his face. "It must be inconvenient having machines out of production for such a long time. You must lose a lot of money."
He could not meet my eyes, and I knew that he was hiding something.
"Well," he said slowly, "the men can operate other machines, of course, but the loss of production is, as you say, inconvenient|Most of his audience was none too distant in age from the speaker himself, the youngest of them easily in his fifties. There was, of course, one exception: a young man standing near the back who scarcely could have been more than thirty, neatly dressed in a navy blue suit with a crimson tie. His thin spectacles sat below his eyes, balanced on the tip of his nose, and he peered over them directly at the speaker|She stood back, every nerve buzzing as he undid Ryan's snap-button jumpsuit with great care and dexterity, although it was clear he'd never performed the task before. Instead of fidgeting as he usually did, Ryan stunned her by chewing on a chart and offering Fareed every cooperation in stripping him down to his diapers.

"You're an extremely well-cared-for little prince, eh, Ryan|Deep inside, a part of her simply wanted him, whether or not he felt the same. And that, she knew, was dangerous. She risked dreadful hurt if all the emotion was only on her side.

“Well then, Ella, will you be going to the game?” she asked as she poured Ella a glass of juice and put her plate on the table.

But you'll have to sort out the mess you're in first|All by itself, even if I hadn't liked Jack, that would have been enough to give me pause, but I'd never felt that much power out of anyone else before. Even Kaleb and Brandon hadn't had access to that kind of white-hot torrent. I was pretty sure that it wasn't possible to be that powerful and not have it result in someone manifesting an ability.

"Yeah... That's pretty much it."

"Right. Well, it depends where you live."

"Brooklyn."

"Oh, me too. So, do you know where the Starbucks is downtown?"

"Uhh..." I think to what I know of downtown from walking to and from the restaurant, but I can't think of a Starbucks|I grabbed my bag and stepped into the elevator; Denny was waiting for me outside by the Limo.

"Morning Denny, where is Connor?" I asked as I looked, and he was not in the Limo.

"Good morning Miss Lane. Mr. Black took the Range Rover to work today."

"Can I ask you a question Denny|"Out with the old and in with the new!" No one asks where the parts are coming from, but everyone knows. And now it's not just ferals that are being unwound-the Juvenile Authority has actually come up with a form that parents can use to send their "incorrigible" teen off for unwinding. At first she doubted anyone would use the form|In fact, an affair, the last thing he'd thought he wanted, might be the only solution, the only means to get Brianne out of his system once and for all and clear his head for the job at hand. Back-assed reasoning, he knew. But a possible solution, nonetheless.

And there was another upside to an affair with Brianne|"Yes, Mom," Melissa said with a laugh.

Anne Marie was beginning to feel like a parent, or rather Melissa was letting her feel like one. Melissa's stepmom. Darn it, she loved how that felt.

Robert would be so proud of them. This was what he'd always wanted for her and Melissa|The objects don’t push back. 
The jolt came again, stronger this time, and suddenly the aisle roared to life and began to push Sven backward. Sven’s cross-trainers tried to find purchase, to keep the aisle immobile, but it was too massive for him to control. He called out to Lars, but Lars was gone, and Sven found himself being pushed backward, unable to get his body out from in front of the aisle|I only entered the race to get clients, nothing more."
The receptionist gasped.  "You're turning down two million dollars?"
"No!" said Blake sharply.  "I'm turning down the run to be governor.  My wife Trudy was right.  I don't know anything about politics.  In fact, like I said, I HATE politics|He glanced again at the magic square, trying to recall the letter that had been in the number one spot near the lower left corner. Think! He closed his eyes, trying to picture the base of the pyramid. The bottom row ... next to the left- hand corner ... what letter was there?

For an instant, Langdon was back in the tank, racked with terror, staring up through the Plexiglas at the bottom of the pyramid|And I would advise that you don’t make any sudden moves.”
The Captain stood in silence for several seconds. “Miss Salton, you have obviously met Mr. Beutcher. Is there anything at all that I can be of assistance with? Food stores? Upgraded bed linens?”
Joni shook her head. “Nope. I think I’m golden right now, Captain|Go tend to your desk, and when you are ready, I will take you down to Bay-68.”
The desk in the corner was stacked high with papers. I wondered if it was just the dumping ground for anyone’s trash who didn’t want to walk down the hall to the recycling chute. I scoured the office for a cart with wheels and was soon making repeated trips to the chute|“Let us depart immediately, then,” suggested Henry. Reinhouer shook his head a second time. “Let me finish repairing the device first – it should take me not much longer. Meanwhile, why don’t you get the furniture out of the car? You won’t fit if it stays there.” Henry nodded and rushed down the stairs, while the professor sat back down and continued his work on the device|Her clean bill of health also meant she was doing well enough to make good on her promise to give me and Jacob 'the best wedding since the royal affair'.

Our definitions of 'best' differed. Mine wasn't prestigious enough to put in history books. I just wanted something small and memorable because it focused on me and Jacob|Seeing the urgency in Pan’s eyes, Ice-Ghost asked Gloo, “Can you fly this?” 
“What? Fly this? I…I…I don’t have any hands. I don’t know. I don’t know.” 
“Fly it, Gloo, you can do it. You must do it.” 
“All right, all right, but I sure wish I had some hands|The ship maintained the gravity according to its orientation, not the earth,” reasoned Mom with obvious relief, as she realized that the stones on the seat did not mean there were aliens on board.  “But why were they there in the first place?” she wondered.
Dad crowded into the small room.
Joseph stood looking at a gold-colored pipe that curved downward from the lower part of the mirror section.  “That must be the faucet.”
“But there is no sink…” argued Sharianna, as Joseph reached out and put his hand under the pipe|They reached the bottom of the stairs, and came upon rows of gas masks hanging on the wall, in plastic containers. They shone their flashlights deeper into the room and saw several heavy glass cubes, two feet high, with steel caps. Grant could see small dark spheres inside the cubes. It was like being in a room full of giant pepper mills, he thought.

Muldoon opened the cap of one, reached in, and withdrew a sphere|He gets the place all fixed up for the beatniks.”
“Ew, beatniks. Let’s not hang around.”
“Hey,” Lil said as he moved off. “Pay up.” She pointed at the parking meter.
“Ah, I can do better than that,” said Tome happily. He took a small, round, furry ball on a piece of string from his coat and hung it on the meter|As soon as the Captain obliged, and the little man spoke into his ear, the Captain's face went as white as a sheet.

"Mr Bones, let me introduce you to Mr Mitchell, a doctor like yourself. I have seen him work magic ashore, with medicines that you, unfortunately do not have. I have invited him aboard to assist you in your work, and to save my crew|He slid off Ares's back onto a polished stone floor and looked around. They were in the High Hall. It was completely empty. Somewhere, not too far away, he could hear music playing.

"Where is everybody?" asked Gregor.

"I do not know. But if there is music, there must be some sort of gathering," replied Ares|“My Lord, thank you for your willingness to assist.”
“Assist?” the duke asked.
“Yes… it would seem that you have quite a few friends who wish to secure your happiness. I’ll let your wards explain the rest. Good-day.”
Both gentlemen quit the room, leaving Carlotta quite alone with the duke|"Well must admit, I never thought that I would be making this call, I have to be quick as I'm in a call box". Emily took his number and rang him back. So Brad could tell her that he was stranded in Wichita and had no idea what to do next. The conversation went on for some time while the whole story was unravelled to Emily|But it was nice in the shade of the porch. They opened the door and windows wide to air out the room.
Emma had cried herself out, both for Sarah and for bitter memories. After some time, she regained her voice, and turned to Hixson. “How did you happen to be here, Hixson|In that moment Mathew dashed to the other side of the bed, grabbed the doctor’s black bag, which was sitting next to one of Mozart’s legs, and raced out of the room.  Just before the door slammed shut behind him, he heard a great roar of laughter.  It was unmistakably Mozart.
He didn’t stop running till he was out the front door. What was he going to do with this bag|Chris thankfully didn’t notice and all I could do in reply was chuckle. I knew Zoe all too well. She was going to protect what she loved at any expense. 
   We trailed the aisles picking up all of Chris’ necessities, including a prepaid smart phone. Zoe led us to sporting goods to buy some ammo. 
   “Better safe than sorry, I always say,” declared Zoe|"I'm the one who-"

"Stop it," Mom hissed. "What is wrong with you two?"

"She's an idiot," Meredith responded. Ignoring Nina completely, she moved toward the table, where she set down a big grocery bag. "I brought you some cabbage pierogies and okroshka, Mom|And so, it was with a deep feeling of satisfaction that he began the washing-up.
However, as the fruity aroma of bubbling washing-up liquid wafted up his nostrils, his contented scrubbing was interrupted by a knock on the front door. ‘Who is it?’ he shouted, without lifting his head up from the sink|Keith shrank back, and as Owen peered out the window, Keith studied his features carefully, the way his chest boomed out, his eyes confidently searched the brush, fearless. Maybe that was what Elise saw in him – the confidence, the self-projection. I can do that. Keith mused.
Soon enough, Owen moved back to the security of the bed, and Keith scuttled forward in the brush|“English, no problem,” she said. “You want old city tour, how many peoples?”
“Just one. Only me.”
“Tour buses have group rates. See many things, not have to walk. That best choice for you.” She said, clearly intending to slot him into an empty seat on one of their buses|She was definitely dancing tonight even if he was the one providing the music.

"I'm sorry you couldn't persuade your sister to come with us," Fen said. She'd tried hard to talk Branislava into rising just for a few hours, but to no avail. Tatijana had accepted her sister's decision, but she'd been disappointed|He thought she must be wearing nearly ten sheer layers, and while he couldn’t see anything but material, he couldn’t seem to stop trying.
He looked back up into eyes that knew exactly what he was thinking, and Sinclair handed her a scrap of paper. “My reference.”
She took it and looked down at it. “Just who did you get to write a reference|When it was over, they lay against each other in the darkness trying to catch their breath.
“One night, I dreamed I was the cello in the painting.” Redding said, as Lin Ming raised herself up on an elbow and traced the contours of his face with her hand.
“You mean the man playing the cello?”
“No, I mean I was the cello|It shone with a glowing blue light that pulsed every few seconds, its luminescence flashing more brilliantly before fading again.

And what Mothball and the others had seen from the balcony was still happening-odd-looking bodies were falling from the blue gash, but none of them had reached the canyon floor yet. About halfway down, they were whisked away-as if caught in a stiff wind or the gale of a hurricane-toward the cliff walls on both sides of the canyon|“You must not have heard me earlier, Amber.  I've been tracking you for a year now.  I followed you to Myrtle Beach from New Orleans,” explained Derek.
Amber began to panic.  “If you followed me, then he could have also,” she whispered.
“No, I made sure no one was watching you or following you other than me,” said Derek|I laugh, though I think about telling him I’m thinking of starting a few businesses that he could pay me to perform.
“Where did you work?”
“New York and we lived in New Jersey.”
“I worked in Newark.”
“You were Chief of Police in Newark?”  He nods.  I try and think of any tickets I received and if they were in Newark|She saw me looking at a picture she had taken out of her wallet,” said Chris.
“A picture of who?” I asked dumbfounded. “That’s no reason to rush out of here.”
“It is, if the picture was a picture of your father with a woman.  I didn’t get a good look at the woman because of the way she was holding it, but it was probably her mother,” said Chris|Dropping a quarter in the slot, he punched out the number and listened to the ring.

On the third ring, Hank answered. "Hello?"

"Hi, Hank. It's me, Blake ... again. I wanted to speak to my wi-to Annie."

"Did you? That wasn't my understanding."

Blake sighed. "Just put her on the line, Hank|She should have known it would all be thrown back at her.

"This is crazy."

"Isn't your brother coming home on Friday for the fundraiser?"

"Yeah."

"Doesn't Rick play bodyguard for Mike?"

"Sometimes."

"Then you'll probably see Rick on Friday at the house ... or at the fundraiser|14 INTERIOR: ANDERSON'S MARKET DAY.

This is a very well equipped grocery store, and in many ways a charming throwback to the groceries of the 1950s. The floors are wood and creak comfortably underfoot. The lights are globes hanging on chains. There's a tin ceiling. Yet there are signs of our modern age; two new cash registers with digital price-readers beside them, a radio scanner on a shelf behind the checkout counter, a wall of rental videos,

and security cameras mounted high in the corners|After one conversation ended and that couple stepped away, Zeke and Amanda were alone, side by side, facing the deepening-blue ocean that grew darker as some evening clouds gathered.

"So, what do you think?" he asked softly, the question innocuous, but the tone was intimate.

"About?"

He didn't answer right away, but smiled|Make a bit of noise, celebrate our friendship and our memories."

"Then I say, let 'er rip," Elise said. She raised her sensibly shod foot and stomped on a bubble. A popping sound exploded in the room.

Barbie went next, her step firm. Her high heels effectively demolished a series of bubbles|"But you're only twelve, and if I do end up moving from Chicago, I can't just leave you in boarding school. You'd have to come with me."

"Then the opera would never get done." Sparkle began rubbing her thumb between her middle and ring fingers. "You're going to make me leave Rise Academy and Kenji and I won't be able to finish the opera|Dana put her hands on her hips and thrust the words at him. ‘You think just because my father is a cook— ‘
‘That’s not what I meant!’
‘What did you mean, then?’
Jina took Dana's hand and said, ‘I don’t want you to go. I’m going to miss you, Dana|“Hmm...” Her mother didn’t look convinced.
Shrugging, she tied the thread and got ready to add more to the rose she’d just started on her veil.
“The poor boy doesn’t stand a chance.”
She gasped.  “Why would marrying me be a burden to him?”
“I didn’t say it would be a burden|Willow kissed her head as she walked by, in search of Tommy.
“Hi dear,” Betty said, breezing out of the kitchen. “Doesn’t the place look festive?”
“It certainly does,” Willow said. “Have you seen Tommy?”
“He’s helping me set the table, aren’t you Tommy|If you think you would like to?” 
Selena felt her stomach drop, like it did when she rode a roller coaster. She could only nod her head as she stared. 
“You’re going to need to get yourself an agent. I can recommend a couple different ones.” He wrote some names and numbers on a notepad, then tore the paper off and handed it to Selena|There is always something beautiful and always something ugly. That's the balance of nature."

Abby interjected, "It's difficult for even me to imagine you being told what to do, Zhang."

"I'll admit that not every aspect of this will be easy for me."

Lil said, "I wish ... I wish I was as good at giving advice as you are, Zhang|Or rather, take turns sleeping and keeping watch."

"That's boring." He reached across the bench and untucked the end of the towel, his fingertips brushing heat across my skin. "Especially when there's other things we could be doing."

"Down boy." I slapped his hand away and re-tucked the towel|Dried milk-encrusted granola in hanging onto the edges of a black garbage bag. These are the things I like."
"Oh. Maybe you should start a Weezer cover band,” he said. “The synth? What are you some 80s douche?” Nathan said.
“Yes, you should know by now Nathan that I’m a douche|The window is coming. Christy, be prepared to leave soon.”
“Window?” Christy looked up into the sky, but could not see anything. “Where? What window, Ice-Ghost? I do not see one.”
Ice-Ghost continued looking into the sky. “It is coming,” he assured Christy|Trista said.

Rachel didn't know what to do. She thought that was a bit abrupt of her to just hand her a beer the second they met.

"Um, no thanks," Rachel said.

"You're a goody, goody," Kelly said. "First you didn't want to get in on my joint, and now the beer|'You call that baring your soul? Ammar, you were speaking in riddles, telling me you realised it wouldn't work and you meant to let me go, blah, blah, blah. Vague nonsense. I still don't understand anything. Understand you.'

'Maybe,' he said, his teeth gritted, 'I don't want to be understood|If you hadn't walked inside the club I would have remained faithful to my wife, and she would be alive and so would my child."

"I don't understand. Why do you have a wife if you like men? What did I do?" Brad asked. The tears were endless, and Ben hated himself for the added pain he was causing.

Ben closed his eyes, and he turned away from Brad|“You know, Sara and I have talked for years about looking for Sanctuary. But we didn’t have the courage to go for it. And we didn’t have the skills to survive in the wild until you showed us all that stuff. Now maybe we’ve got half a chance.”
“What if you don’t find Sanctuary|They have no art as such, only the bald description of personal experience. And as such, they lack the power to evoke their emotions in others. They lack the tools that would allow them to do so. When they want the reader to feel sad, they have no power to make it so. They can only describe a time when they were sad|It didn't make a whole lot of sense, but I couldn't think of any other reason she'd be hiding things like this from me, or why Dusty had suddenly decided to cook dinner with me, seeing as how he couldn't cook at all.

But of course, I pretended that I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. I'd play along.

Dusty stayed for dinner and I was also shocked to discover that he'd brought homework, as well. Call me crazy, but he just didn't seem like the kind of guy who would do homework|I glanced over at the table and saw that the only people left were people who I didn't know. "That's a great idea. Mina and I have tons to talk about. Plus, I want to catch up with Max and Noah too."

He kissed me deeply before walking off to join his band mates, and I turned back to Mina|Sophie had used a car service to get to the memorial service from the airport, but had dismissed them when she had arrived.  She knew she would be able to get a ride from one of them.  Katrina and Sophie didn't speak very much on their ride to the apartment.  Katrina decided now would be a good time to breach the subject of the laptop.
"Sophie, I know this might not be the best time, but I was wondering if you'd take a look at my laptop, it isn't working," said Katrina|He then turned around to discover his father sitting in his bed, looking up at him in silence, a vacant expression on his face.  
“Dad?” responded Charlie, shaking in fear.    
“Charlie,” Joe James replied.    
He was unsure what to believe now.    
“I was sent here with a message, my boy,” said Joe|Don't worry, I'll let you get back to it soon. I only want your opinion."

Blast her, had she come here to throw him off guard on purpose? When had she gotten so good at the game?

"My opinion on what?" he asked. "Your new hat?"

"Not my hat, although thank you for noticing|I push against his chest, harder and harder until he has to let me go. Logan's on his away across the room. I shove Trip back and slide my hand into the crook of Logan's arm. I brush my hair back from my face. "What are you doing here, Trip|"No, because of something I did. Something that I wanted to make right. I'm not sure I can anymore." She'd clung to hope for so long, but it was vanishing.

Jamie came closer. Hesitated, then awkwardly patted her shoulder.

Cassie almost started crying again. "We ... we're still looking for your family, Jamie|But like every journey, no matter how long or winding, it wends its way back, at last, to the beginning.
"I'm afraid," said Arima.
"I've taken care of you so far," he said.
"That's not what I mean," she said. "We're coming to the end."
"Of a cruise. Don't be afraid, it's just a cruise|And if you are smart and loyal and brave you'll get your cut of the profits.  So, you have two big incentives to masquerade as a Krull refuge.  1) The whole Kingdom of Avallonia will accuse you of being a worthless coward if you don't pose as a Krull refuge.  And, 2) There won't be any cash for you - no book deal, no product endorsement deals, and no celebrity appearance deals for you, if you refuse to masquerade as a Krull refuge|We have to get her into surgery. There’s no time."
And then the sheet on the cart moved. Alyssa realized for the first time that there was a person under the sheet. At the sound of "her daughter," Alyssa's mother lifted her head up.
Their eyes met, and Alyssa realized who was on the cart|She had won the barrel racing event and, with her eyes still locked with Matt’s, she moved to Rusty and quickly swung into the saddle. She broke the stare finally, as she trotted Rusty into the arena to collect her blue ribbon. 
Matt had drawn his own crowd and, as Selena returned with her blue ribbon, she saw a group of teenagers surrounding him. He signed autographs and laughed as he joked with the group, until finally he was able to break away and join Selena by her horse trailer, where she was unsaddling Rusty|From:

Graham stepped in first, followed by Ellie, but they both paused just beside the coat rack that was shaped like a giant fishhook. Every single pair of eyes in the restaurant had snapped up at their entrance; forks were lowered and lobsters forgotten as they collectively stared at the pair by the door. Ellie's first instinct was to duck behind the hostess stand, or to turn and walk back outside; after so much time spent worrying about this exact scenario, it was odd to stand here before a crowd of faces-some familiar, others not-and let herself be seen with Graham|"We're to have tea when Mama comes in," Jamie said. He didn't seem at all nervous at Sir Alistair's presence. But then he was blissfully rubbing the dog's ears.

Sir Alistair grunted.

"And eggs and ham and bread and jam," Jamie recited. He often forgot things, but not things that had to do with food|Except Monique, who stuck out like a very angry sore thumb among the debuts. Sophronia counted forty-five students in all.

Captain Niall walked along the row, examining the sticks.

When he got to Dimity he took the stick from her. "An interesting choice."

"I like the shape and smoothness," said Dimity|Mindful of the promise he had made to Lord Nexus, Michael had originally intended to go straight to the Black Lotus monastery to speak with Solomon about letting the mage have access to the monastery’s library.  However, with Patrick missing he recognized that he could ill afford to be absent from his Knights for any longer than absolutely necessary.  Consequently he had decided he would first check in at The Tears of Belenus before heading to the monastery|It was too tempting. Too easy."

One of his father's first tasks was to get the Hoegbotton army across the Moth in a way that allowed quick return. He accomplished this with boats, with floating bridges that could be taken apart and reused in other ways. From there, "the Fixer," as he came to be called, participated in more than a dozen battles|His sheriff truck was parked in the pole barn, the barn door wide open, inviting me in. I pulled out a can of spray paint I’d purchased from Ray’s and compared the yellow can cover to the color of Blaze’s rusted-out sheriff’s truck.
Close enough, I thought, and began spraying|It only happens when you meet your mate and it starts the countdown to the time that you will fully transform.” His body tensed like he didn’t want to tell me that.
“Transform?” It didn’t sound pleasant and with the way his body reacted, I doubted that it was.
“Yes, to be with me you have to transform|The process repeated one hundred and eighty thousand years ago when the Weald-Artois Anticline ridge failed again. The resulting flood finished digging out the English Channel and the caves.

2) The formation of the rift in the cliff (Location: Present-day Etretat)

The Weald-Artois flood created many lakes in surrounding valleys. An inland fresh water sea was formed on the mainland, not far from the caves|How could he have known Saturday was the last time he’d ever get to do that with her, that she’d be dead two days later?
Biting the side of his tongue and rubbing his nose, Shane suppressed the tears. Granny was in a box, in the dirt, and there wasn’t jack he could do about it. The idea of being buried after he died gave Shane the heebie-jeebies, but it didn’t bother Granny|And now you've gone and slept with a guy I told you I liked, and you've thrown yourself at the man I'm in love with. You don't want me to be happy."

Marley sighed, her heart shattered, her will gone. She couldn't fight this, couldn't change Lizzie. "Believe what you want. Stay here and do whatever you want, Lizzie|You think I lied about it?"

He'd earned her antagonism. "Not after today. You had a keen grasp on the subject. I'm curious to see how far along you are in your studies."

"I have fifteen hours of classes left before I get my degree. I can't go full-time because of work and...well, money|In reality, it was just yet another way for guys to gawk at pretty girls.
Amber kept thinking to herself.  This was the first time Darren had actually followed through with details and a specific plan for how to do something like this.  Maybe he was on to something.  Finally, she said, “Sorry, Darren|As she passed the trailers, she noticed the crowds were thinner than usual, and she remembered Graham saying they'd be filming out on the water. Even so, she spotted one of the photographers smoking a cigarette off to the side, and she quickened her pace, still unsettled by the morning's conversation. She was grateful her first shift was at Sprinkles; even if Quinn was still mad at her, it would be better than being stuck in a small space with Mom all day as she tried to figure out what she was going to do about Graham|“We planted you in the bar where you supposedly met me for the first time.  We used pheromone hypnosis so that you’d fall only for me that night.  Continual 4M treatments.  It worked, Amber.  You became my real wife.  My willing wife.  That’s all I ever wanted from you, Amber|“But you really can’t blame me for planning to destroy the Indomitable. Hell, I would have been doing you a favor.”
“A favor?” growled the Admiral, his previous rage abruptly returning.
“Yes, yes,” mused Le Jaunte, his unsettling smirk that of a man who knew he had won. “You should, in fact, be thanking me for what I did, Admiral|"Yes. Dave is meeting me for dinner."

"And you're going to tell him that your relationship is over with him, right?"

Jade looked up at him, the worry in her eyes once again. "Angelo, you really terrify me. I don't want to break up with Dave|Something waved from the darkness of the tunnel: something white. It was a handkerchief on a stick. "Hello?" called Richard.

The feather-wrapped roundness of Old Bailey stepped out of the gloom, looking self-conscious and ill at ease. He was waving Richard's handkerchief, and he was sweating. "It's me little flag," he said, pointing to the handkerchief|"I accepted his proposal because I thought I'd never see you again. You might have been too late."

Elliot let amusement slip through the shivering horror in his mind. "No fear of that. I had Ainsley keep an eye on you and tell me everything you did."

"But..." Juliana looked bewildered. "When on earth did Ainsley find time to be your spy|Ella had given up and gone upstairs, the night aging.

Jordan started to quiet, soothed by Spike's warm body, his adrenaline finally running down. Spike's eyes drifted closed, the slowing staccato of Jordan's heartbeat somehow comforting.

He woke up to sun pouring in the windows. Spike had shifted to human sometime in the night, and so had Jordan|“When the time comes, you’ll know.”  Liam took Claire’s hand folding it over her pouch.  “The Empress saw a light in you that you can’t see through the darkness of your own doubts.  And I can see it too.”
Claire squeezed the pouch then smiled looking up at Liam|Angel had been so shocked and turned on by what she'd seen that she'd stood and watched. Lash hadn't spoken a word throughout. He'd stood behind her with his arms wrapped around her waist, holding her against him.

The love was clear to see shining between Hardy and Rose. She wished things were different for her and Lash|The sailor frowned awhile, then said, "There is nothing at all interesting in the ship's brig."

"Thank you very much," said Amos, and walked on till he came to another sailor, whose feet were awash in soapsuds. The sailor was pushing a mop back and forth so hard that Amos decided he was trying to scrub the last bit of color off the grey boards. "Good evening to you too," said Amos|"I know danger!"

An abrupt sense of peril very near was followed almost immediately by a figure joining them out of a doorway.

Bijaz crouched and whimpered.

It was only Stilgar moving like a war machine, head thrust forward, feet striking the street solidly.

Swiftly, Paul explained the value of the dwarf, handed Bijaz over to Stilgar|Scott parks the jeep along the road and we all walk down the path together, Morgen leading the way. The trees open up and the garden appears before us. Morgen leads me through the rows, showing me the vegetables growing and ripening. We find pea pods to pick and carrots to pull. I can hardly wait until everything’s ready to harvest|In my experience they would have remembered by now and realized what they were doing. And stopped.”
“No such luck here,” said Gabriel.
“No,” said Flannery. “No such luck here.”
“I don’t think we can rule that out though.”
“What?”
“That the mirrors may be involved, with the blanket, somehow,” said Gabriel|"There's so much to learn, that's all."
They wandered around for a while, chattered with a few of the locals until they saw Kate waving them back to the airplane. A few moments later, the engines started and they were off and flying adjacent to snow covered peaks.
Reid came back and told the girls to go up to the cockpit|Could be a bit dodgy.
“Channel 19 on your radio,” Clayton told Miller, “for direct contact with your support. The Swiss Army will be listening out, so don’t hesitate to use it as an emergency frequency. They’re used to working in that terrain.”
“So I should hope,” said Miller|"I asked you, how do you know her name?"
"I know everything, Stacey Olson Caldwell.  I know all about your unquenchable, body aching woe; malaises that I can make go away."
"What do you know about my heartache?"  I asked, daring Asp to continue.
"I can behold it in your eyes, Stacey|You’re the only daughter I have left.  I love you.  I just wanted to make sure you received the announcement concerning our anniversary.”
“No I haven’t.  We haven’t checked the mail yet.  It’s not like I’m invited,” I said coolly.
“Darling, of course you’re not invited|He kissed my cheek. "Come right back though."

"We will."

There was a huge line in the bathroom, but Hailey pulled us all the way to the front. I'm guessing people figured out who we were, because no one got mad. After washing my hands, I couldn't find Hailey|When Sebastian turned toward the kitchen, making his way to the door that led to the garage, I spoke up, concerned. "Um," I began uncertainly. "What about Lilly?"

Was he just going to leave her alone in the house, unattended, with no idea where he'd gone if she awakened?

"Our housekeeper's here," he said nonchalantly.

"Oh, I didn't know you had a housekeeper|A reporter who doesn’t like Shakespeare. I’m going to have to keep my English students away from you.”
“Considering you’re an English teacher, perhaps I should apologize for not liking Shakespeare.”
She flashed a captivating smile. “I was only teasing, at least somewhat. I do have to admit being a bit surprised by a reporter that doesn’t appreciate the beauty of Shakespeare|The host said, "Not long enough."

I was as humiliated as I would have been if I had done something.

"This is perfect. Let's just go."

Something burned furiously in Cole's eyes, but he shoved out of the booth and tossed his napkin contemptuously on the table. "Rumor works both ways," he told the host|Even though I have a strong dislike for both of them, they’re the only people in my vicinity.
“Send it up!” Mika commands.
“How?” Josh and I ask simultaneously.
“Tie zee rope to zee chest and ve vill pull it up!” Mika snaps her fingers and motions for Ludwig to take the rope|I EXCLAIMED. The dream birds singing in the garden fell silent. "With them? Is that why they called the guardians?'

Sonya's calmness continued, but she frowned slightly. "Victor and Robert didn't call the guardians. Why would they?' "Because ... because they wanted to get rid of Dimitri and me ...'

"Perhaps,' said Sonya|Cursing himself for openly gawking at her, he made quick work of her corset, all the while hoping she wouldn't lose her nerve, not now.

"You are-" he said untying the first of her several laces "-by far-" another was loosened "-the most tantalizing woman I have ever seen."

She let out a gasp as he roughly pulled another lace. Fingers numbly went about loosening the rest of her laces|"Should I try for some of those water-casks, sir?" Roland called up.

"Tell her no," Laurence said to Temeraire, "but you ought to drink whichever of them you can reach, yourself, and let Iskierka and Kulingile do the same; and you had better eat those sheep."

"Those fellows in the belly-netting will be thirsty very soon," Temeraire pointed out, "and so will you, Laurence|There’s no call to treat the lady in such a way!” Lord Darby’s voice interrupted her sweet interlude, her secret satisfaction at the duke’s willingness to create that much of a scene.
Never had she ever considered compromising so… romantic.
“Please, my lord.” She held up her hand, sparing him only a slight glance before turning back to the duke|Pretty good, really and I picked up another referral, plus a possible job from one of the mothers there.  All the children were darling, but I should have let you help me out today, Scott…”
“I wish you had – I was pretty useless at the winery today… Just ask my dad.”
She frowned. “Why would your dad think you were useless|"It hides a special light which can be programmed to simulate the sunrise.  It's on a timer," Iramy explained.  "It helps diffuse depression from not knowing when sunrise and sunset is.  Many survivalists use these in their bunkers."
"How do you know about all this doomsday stuff?" Jeremy asked.
"The General and I did a lot of research when he decided to build the bunker|We sat in silence for a moment, and I was feeling somewhat emotional; I'm blaming the wine, when I started to speak.

"It was my sixteenth birthday when I was diagnosed with cancer." I felt him look at me as I just stared ahead listening to the whispers of the ocean. "Hey, happy sweet sixteen, guess what, you have cancer|You know about John Paul, you know about Stumps and now you know everything about Barbeau.  And you would prevent my ultimate possession of the pearl.  I can't let you do that.  I've worked too hard to get to this point.  The pearl means everything to me!  You must know that."  
"Yes."
"And you know everything there is to know about the pearl|You didn’t have to. He was my friend…”
An intense pressure begins to pound the walls of his brain. It feels like an animal trying to claw its way out.
T1-07 screams.
“I’m outta here,” the unfamiliar voice says over the speakers.
“But, General Kole—”
A door slams shut, leaving only the man with the once-calm voice|Mack sighed, dusted off his hands, and swung his legs to the floor. "Mia, don't do this. You're a smart young woman, and I am an extremely well-trained man. If I wasn't, why would King trust your safety to me?"

"I just want to go to the gym, Mack|I didn't move-did I want him to find me?

He did.

Our eyes locked, and the intensity of his expression-it was all-consuming. Maybe I couldn't read all of my own emotions, but in his gaze I saw three with clarity. Surprise, elation. And, clear as day, I saw love|‘That’s wonderful, amazing!’ Chrissy blurted elatedly into the phone, almost swerving off the road in her excitement. ‘But how, how did she come back just like that? Did she say why she’d gone away in the first place?’
‘No no, of course not, Chrissy|“I want you to know something,” he said.  “Nobody wants you on the girls’ team.  Naturally, the other schools don’t want you on that team.  The parents don’t want you on the team.  The other girls don’t even want you on the team.  The only person who does want you is the coach|He saw the food that the guard had given her and piled the bread, cheese and water flask into Matilda's bag that he had over his shoulder.
Signalling her to follow him, he went over to where he had come in, lifted the bottom of the tent and watched as Matilda slid out to freedom. Zinzabad followed behind.
Once they were outside they hurried to the cover of the surrounding jungle. Zinzabad took off the shoulder bag and handed it to Matilda|CHAPTER FIVE

Opening my eyes, I blinked hard, the watery morning sun surprising me as I stared at my strange surroundings. Where the hell was I? Memories flooded back to me slowly, of the night before. The club and the beautiful red-head. Richard and what he had done. And of course David. The way he had saved me. He had told Richard that he thought I was beautiful, that I belonged to him...

Carefully I turned in the bed but there was no sign of David|It should be on the cover of some magazine, shouldn't it?" he said.

Victoria's eyes narrowed. "What do you mean?" she demanded, knowing that Scott's hopes were flying high now that there was the possibility of a magazine layout.

"What do you think I mean, Victoria|He was a betting beast and he was betting that no-one knew they were coming so the element of surprise was all theirs.
He was right.  There were ten Esperanzi in his new pack and they tore at the cloaked doors and broke them down.  They spread out in teams of two and searched the Library.  There weren’t many people present in the Library|The approving cheers, whoops and whistles were more raucous than before; but, when she turned and did the same toward the Union camp, the response was muted. 
Anna jammed the flagpole into the ground, reached into her pocket and pulled something out. The object fell from her hands. She bent over and quickly picked it up; somehow I knew that it was a box of matches.
Fearfully, I said, “She’s going to burn the flag|"You-you are insane, aren't you?" Claire looked at her sideways, through clinging strands of hair. "I

mean, all that stuff about the world ending-it's some kind of bizarre game you're playing with your weird

friends, isn't it? Some kind of Dungeons and Dragons stuff..."

"What do you think, Claire|Parts of her body were hot and other parts were cold. Dak stood next to her, staring at something in his hands. She followed his gaze and saw that he clutched the Infinity Ring.

The soldiers were nowhere to be seen - but neither were Dak's parents.

He was frozen, his eyes glued to the Ring|Her skin didn't have that dewy glow, and she didn't blush that way, to bring out her cheekbones. And her lips definitely didn't have that breathless ready-to-be-kissed look.

"It's the lipstick," Suzan explained. "Don't smudge it."

"It's possible," said Melanie, "that you've gone too far, Suzan|‘Yes, yes, I know.’
Chrissy felt Jial’s chest rise and fall in a deeply resigned sigh.
‘It…it’s the same thing,’ Jial said, her eyes closing as she spoke. ‘The same thing as Zorbielle’s disappearance.’
Chrissy moved back a little.
‘Emma’s younger than I am, Jial|It was a dark night, and only starlight and moonlight from a crescent moon were reflecting back from the layers of turbulent cloud below, making it difficult to see what was happening in the normal spectral range.
Two of the images on the screens were therefore showing what the satellites above were observing in the infra-red and micro-wave frequency ranges, on Screens 'B' and 'C' respectively. Both of these images were also rather dark, but as the hurricanes collided, the area around the collision between the hurricanes, suddenly started to light up with activity in the infra-red and micro-wave ranges|Of course, those dreams were about my grandmother not a tunnel or some other metaphorical thing. I did not eat or sleep in the two weeks that followed my grandmother’s death. While trying to deal with her death a counsellor told me that sleep and food were essential to get through a grieving period. The counsellor explained to me how not eating or sleeping causes chemical changes to take place, which make it harder to deal with grief|We were about halfway through our meal when we hit a lull in our conversation. I hadn’t meant to pry, but suddenly I heard myself asking, “I was wondering what it was about Christmas that you didn’t like?”

He raised an eyebrow. He does that a lot. He paused for a long minute and then said, “How do you know that I don’t like Christmas|Moral code? Hah.
And to think that I’d been afraid that my status as a domestic terrorist would never benefit me. Never say never, am I right?
Feeling evil villain powerful, I hefted my two free cups of coffee and hightailed it back to work. The good news was that it had only taken me ten minutes to get the coffee|The zombie began to turn, using his whole body. By now the other zombies had caught up, shuffling their feet, cajoling and bumping against one another as they bustled down the alleyway toward her.
Maisie pushed herself to go as fast as she could, ignoring the pain in her calf. She managed a speed only marginally faster than the zombies|I hadn't realized that I'd been staring at it long enough for the guys to be done helping out.

Brooks walked into the room and was shocked to find me still inside. He closed the door behind him and crossed his arms over his chest.

I stood up and walked toward him, until our faces were almost touching. "How long have you been in love with me, Brooks|I really didn’t get it. Basically Holt had yet to tell me anything bad.
“It’s bad,” said Holt, “because we both have to find brides.”
“You what?” I asked, shocked. What century did we live in again? 
“Why do you have to find brides|Zoe continued to sit in the living room, her feet propped up at the coffee table.
Ana said, “This also means that when you start school, you’ll have to do homework on your own. That goes for you, too, Zoe.”
“What school? I don’t speak Vietnamese,” said Zoe|Spencer let out a hoarse gasp. Suddenly, Ali didn't quite look like the girl who was with them today.

Then Spencer's gaze fell to the silver ring on the girl's finger. Ali had said she hadn't been wearing a ring that night, but there it was. Only, except instead of an A in the center, there was a C.

Why did Ali have on the wrong ring|Tomorrow will be better anyway because it's Saturday, so I don't have classes, and most of the other kids will be at the band concert. It'll probably be a waste of time, but at least it will keep me from sitting in my room all day worrying."

"They're not going to let you come to the concert|My body went airborne, flying backward. I hit the floor back first, my breath gone as a man instantly landed on top of me. I threw my hands up...but I was not fast enough. A fist slammed against the side of my face. At least, I think it was a fist|Blood spurted from the wound, forming a puddle on the wet asphalt.
Shane cursed and fell to his knees next to Matt, wanting to help him. He didn’t have a clue where to start.
“Now try to lie still,” he said with a shaky voice, holding Matt’s shoulders to steady him.
“Get some first aid kits, some blankets, and an arrow, Aaron,” Tracy shouted, then squatted on the other side of Matt|Billy took a deep breath, before heading toward what he hoped would be his own fresh start.
He passed an 800-series black BMW, confirming that this place might be just a bit out of his price range. He still wasn’t sure why they had rented the cottage to him at such a bargain cost. Just rich people doing some charity work, he guessed|To his amazement, the showerhead was now twisted a few degrees further than it had been in the morning. He got his magnifying glass and compared the photos with the showerhead more closely. The numbers were indeed the same, but they were placed slightly differently on the showerhead. A cold chill swept through him. There could be no doubt; this was not the same showerhead|Will then reached inside the car and pulled out the Book of the Underground.    “You’ve got the book!” replied Charlie.  “Nice work, Will.”    
Unexpectedly, a startling Sheila then dropped to her feet in between the three.  She was back to normal girl-with-wings form.    “Hi, I take it you’re one of Charlie’s friends,” she said, turning to Will|We took a soft right curve at the next intersection and began following a less worn path. Forced to work harder, the dogs slowed to a brisk trot, giving me time to assess my situation. I noticed a large claw hook in the basket next to me tied to a rope attached to the sled.
I picked up the hook and whipped it at the next small tree we passed, hoping it would anchor around the tree and stop the sled|"I'll never hear the end of this shit."

Zane laughed and squeezed him close. Ty patted his arm and stopped walking. To Zane's surprise, Ty was grinning.

"Stars and stripes, Zane."

"What?"

"It's the Fourth of July. I saw stars, and then I saw stripes|"Well, they're your dogs," said Mitch with a smile.  "Why don't you make them stop eating?"
"Consarn it, I can't!" growled the claim jumper.  "Your stew's done got 'em under some kind 'o spell."
"There's no spell," said Mitch|He sets it on the tree stump. “Now stand like this, then swing and try to get it off to the side like this, not in the middle.” I get into position and raise the axe. “You want ta swing as fast an’ hard as you can.”
I set my sights on the wood, and swing|I dreamed I was lying tied up and captive, and the man was not there. I could see him over by the water talking to that huge crocodile we saw today and promising it that in the morning as the sun began to rise it would be given its next meal, and the meal would be me. The man was keeping me tied up so that in the morning he could give me to the crocodile|Much of the Earth is too cold for us but we found areas like here in the Mojave Desert which are near an ocean with plenty of sunlight. My planet is near the warmest edge of the habitable zone and we live on the coolest polar areas of Oma. Most of Oma is too hot for us."
"So why did you want to leave your planet|Thank you."  Olivia touched her chest lightly with her hand.
	"When can you leave?  Today?"
	"Tomorrow at the earliest."
	"Excellent.  I'll have a ship ready."
	"Should I come here?"  Olivia stood up.
	"Yes, I would recommend that you take your husband with you, Olivia|It was as if, knowing the connection between the two, Duke’s noble fight for justice, his protection of the United States and all the good it stood for, was elevated from calling to crusade, from vocation to dedication, hallowed by the sacred trust the Shadow President placed in him.
“Goodspeed got ganked,” said Duke.
“That happens,” said the Shadow President.
“You’re telling me,” said Duke|“Two weeks. Do you think the world can manage to stay afloat another two weeks?”
“Of course,” said Simmons, who wasn’t sure whether Jones was kidding or not.
“The trial will put an end to this,” said Jones.
“I sure hope so,” said Simmons|His black eyes went ice-cold, a graveyard reflected there. His rugged features went completely expressionless, perfectly still, as if carved from stone.

Great. She'd seen that expression before. Mack wasn't taking this well. She forced a smile into her voice and greeted Joe.

Kane winced at the sweetness in Jaimie's voice and glanced at Mack|I think on her way to our house, she stopped at the first discount store she came to and charged them or wrote a bad check for them," I said. "Or maybe she took those things from whoever she took this baby from." Martin flinched.

"We have to talk about it, Martin|It’ll have government markings,” the foreman instructed. Chan stood just outside the front door where he knew he’d have the best vantage point. This fellow must be a really big shot, indeed, if the government sent one of its own cargo vehicles instead of a contract hauler.
The two master technicians showed up and there was some loud but indecipherable grouching from the foreman|Tears, hugs, explanations and introductions followed before everyone returned to the main cave and only Doug hung back looking tired and worried.
Reid noticed and turned professional. "I'll look at your wound, Lad," he said. "Kate will you get my medical bag from the boat, please."
"Sure, Reid," she replied and left the cave|Coworkers described her as fun and friendly part of the time she worked with them and cautious and guarded the rest of the time.  Whitney Levi, one of the nurses Amber had worked with told him of the day she left and that she had asked about Josh.
Video surveillance showed a pale faced Amber leaving the hospital shortly after hearing the news without stopping to check on Josh|Or a little sister, which is even worse. What’s worse yet is that I think of him as an older brother.
“Kin?” Geroge asked, as if reading my mind.
“Might as well be,” I muttered.
Ryse and Geroge cleared their throat at the same time.
Geroge said, “Ah, I won’t take it all from you, Ryse|On seeing this little storehouse of antique, post-modern, and contemporary information blocks there was little doubt, thought Omar, that anything he needed to know for his future projects rested close to home.
“So what’s your belief?” Wynnet asked as he set the stark-white, steaming mugs on the table.
“I’m sorry, could you repeat that please?” Omar pleaded.
“Certainly. I said, ‘So what’s your belief|As they walked closer, the children spotted them and the engine turned off. Nisha walked to within about five meters of the tallest one, who was slightly taller than her. She pointed to herself and said, "Hello, I'm Nisha."
She pointed to Rachel and said her name. The tallest one watched Nisha and one eye moved over to Rachel|Her voice began to rise, the shock from the day’s events threatening to become hysterics. Dylan sighed and took her hands in his.
“I know you love him, but the truth is that he is not worthy of you.” He began, cursing himself silently when tears sprang into her eyes.
“What exactly are you saying, Dylan|She was on the porch waiting for her sister. She was antsy, all right. She wanted that bike put together this instant.
“Mom won’t be home for another hour,” Anna said, “so you’re going to have to wait.”
“Nah, it’s okay,” I said to Anna|Yadira was lying on the floor near Itzel, stretched out on her side, watching her friends, some of whom were now up on their feet shoving white filler into the holes in the adobe wall using wide trowels.  After they had put an insufficient quantity of the filler into one hole, they stepped back confidently and admired their handiwork.
“It’s kinda going in too far,” said a critic from the floor.  “You need to fill it to go out some cuz it’s gonna shrink|Alex stood for a moment to think of the proper sentence structure.  "Li ti-min ret o-run-ga."  The words came out slowly.  
An opening in the wall moved inward--the girls backed up in surprise.
	"How did you do that?"  Rosa asked.
	"I just said, I want a green stone, in Dwarf, and it opened|He appeared dazed and pushed her hands away as if she were irritating him.

"Well, that was a surprise."

Caia looked up to see Reuben clambering back inside through the window he had just been thrown out of. He brushed pieces of glass off and then grinned unrepentantly. "Looks like I'm not impervious to you, Caia|"This is ridiculous and getting us nowhere.' He glanced at his brother. "Robert?'

Robert hadn't done much so far today, but at Victor's command, Robert leaned forward. "Sonya?'

Still obviously distraught, she turned to look at him ... and her face went still.

"Tell us what we need to know,' said Robert|Colby forced her body to move, sitting up, sweeping back the wealth of hair tumbling around her face. "I'm sorry. I guess I'm more tired than I thought. I set the alarm for four-thirty so I could do a few extra things."

"I knew you were getting up early!" Ginny pounced on that. "You can't do that all the time, Colby|They had made a lasting impression on him, and he certainly didn’t need to meet up with any of them. He shook away that thought and concentrated on his journey. Fear and self-doubt will not get you anywhere.
The rushing water was becoming louder—like it might be some kind of a waterfall. He stopped and felt the need to contact Pluggo for moral support. He retrieved his Metro out of his backpack, and called Pluggo|The memory of long, delicate fingers winding around Reeber’s limbs flashed before Frank’s eyes. 
“Frank,” Jimmy intoned. “I have a special mission tonight. It’s dangerous. It will take me out of the fort. I need you to stay here and do what you did today.”
“Out of the fort? What do you mean, out of the fort|Trying to be discrete, I glanced over to Elizabeth, sure the simple sentence would cause her great distress, before uttering softly, "Of course, sweetheart." I understood what that sentence meant. She had accepted me, not only as her daddy, but also as her parent. Clearly, Elizabeth understood it too. Her face flashed red, burning resentment.

I watched my daughter until she disappeared into a red tube before I slowly turned to face Elizabeth|He pushed a hand through his dark hair, the other held onto his cowboy hat. Serious eyes…
“I said I didn’t know her very well…”
“That’s correct…” Dale stopped what he was doing and looked over at him.
“And then you said that was my mistake, right?”
“Yes…”
“What are you trying to say, Dale|I pull my shako down low over my eyes and leave then so they won't see the tears about to spill.

As I ride away, I hear their cheer of Vive la France! Vive Lieutenant Bouvier!

Reporting to Napoleon's staff, I am assigned to a pool of messengers. All of them are like me-young and small and quick. We ride alongside the moving column in a group, and when our names are called, we ride forward to take our orders and then are off at the gallop|Not knowing what else to do, I sat back down and let Hugo do the pacing and slapping for both of us.
“Okay, I’ve got it! It’s that ancient prophecy…” Hugo ran both hands through his hair. “I researched the Wizard Queen thing before the party, and by the way, I’m pretty sure that’s you. And this has something to do with the prophecy|He did not get out of bed until much later, and when he did, Otto noticed that his employer had started re-packing things, slowly and silently, returning books and knick-knacks to moving boxes that still lay around. Mr. White was holding a book in his hands when a knock came to the front door.
"Don't answer it," he told Otto|You have my assurance of that.”
After hanging up, there was a gentle tap on the door and Rachael said, “Yes?”
The door opened and Cybil entered, more demure than any time Rachael had seen her before.  “Rachael, can we talk?”
Rachael stiffened, “Ah, sure, Cybil|His pants were wet, his shirt tails soaking, and Eli yelled, “My kite, my kite,” as the kite drifted down the beach.
The man looked with distaste at Eli, holding him out as if he was something indescribably nasty.
Mel jogged the short distance, Britney laughing with each bounce, and when she reached him, she apologized. “I’m so sorry this has happened.” 
His cool gaze zeroed in on Britney, then back to Mel|"And I think Mari will have stories for you of chasing fishes under the ocean."

The Carousel of Spirits
Originally published in Sorcerous Signals

The carousel turned, and Artie watched the ponies go by.  He shifted his weight as he sat on the green, metal frame bench.  It was one of many around the edges of the giant, window-walled room that housed the carousel|You really mustn't take it so hard just because I've had an awful dream.'

'That ... that ... that isn't the reason, ma'am.' The maid's voice was quivering terribly.

'Then for heaven's sake what is the reason?'

'I'm very sorry about the tray, ma'am.'

'Oh, don't worry about the tray|Listen you hired me for an hour and if you want to spend an hour stuttering and talking, that’s fine by me.” said Candace as she pushed her way in. Bob was stunned. This was not the woman in the ad, this was three times the size of the woman in the ad and he still wasn’t sure what had just happened-she looked horrendous. “You, ah, don’t look like your ad,” said Bob|Anderson, his direct report at the other end of the line, spoke with a southern accent, Texan through and through, and proud of it.
“She is, well, spellbinding,” said Roth.
“Spellbinding?”
“Yes.”
“As in sorcery?”
“Now that you mention it,” said Roth|Well, I guess you know where you were. I’d just heard that. I think Mrs. Klassen across that street said it. You know better than me if your band—orchestra—was in Brazil. Come on, Poo-poo. Bring me the ball.”
Chloe didn’t know if she’d been to Brazil|And the eyes... Katherine's eyes had been a color he had never seen before; darker than sky blue, as rich as the lapis lazuli in her jeweled headband. This girl had those same eyes.

And they were fixed directly on his as she smiled. He looked down from the smile quickly. Of all things, he did not want to think about Katherine|“Well, this is Kira’s house so… there’s food.”
Kira frowned. “Please tell me we can eat food?” she asked.
“Yeah, we can, lucky you.”
Tristan shook his head and walked over to us, a stack of papers in his hands. “Here,” he said, handing it to Kira|“Mom…do you think that, maybe, Mrs. Bauer’s been right about me all along?”
“Matt…quiet.”
“She says that I’m nothing but trouble…”
“Matt, you’re a beautiful, kind-hearted boy and always have been.”
“Did you know that Johnny doesn’t want to be my friend anymore…”
“Johnny will always be your friend, Matt|Cassie demanded, unwilling to concede to his wishes yet, unwilling to leave him here while they were exiled.

"I'll have help," he murmured.

"Who?" Melissa inquired. "If we go, who will you have to help you?"

Devon stroked the back of her head, his eyes pleading with her for understanding|“You need to change gear,” Chris said, his voice a rasping gasp. “Push down on the clutch. Let the accelerator up at the same time, and change into second gear. Then take your foot off the clutch and press down on the accelerator.”
“Lift up the accelerator,” Maisie said out loud as she carried out the instructions, “and push down on the clutch|I moved my straw around the glass.

"He's good at pretending he's over her, but he's not."

"By her you mean Allie?" I sure hoped there wasn't another ex-girlfriend, but hearing he wasn't over anyone didn't feel great.

"Yeah. He's crazy in love with her still|When he clasped Fen's forearms in the warrior's greeting, Fen could see the droplets of scars down the right side of his face, almost like tears, all the way to his jaw. The same strange scars ran up his temple and disappeared into his hairline.

"Bur tule ekamet kuntamak-well met, brother-kin," the third brother greeted Fen. "It is good you found your lifemate. I have thought often of you over the last centuries, and hoped I would never have to meet you in battle|Please don’t do this.” 
Gael may not have been as big or muscular as Xanthus, but he was still much stronger than she was. Sara was helpless as he put her hand through the metal ring and locked it in place, closing it tightly around her wrist. 
“Please, don’t do this, Gael|"Can I get you something warm to drink?" Peggy asked.

"No, thanks." His response was gruff, almost unfriendly.

"What brings you out here on a night like this?" Bob pressed. "We aren't exactly on the beaten path."

"None of that's important just now," Peggy said, glaring at Bob|“I know Sergei’s office is above the casino, but I don’t know if you have to go through the main casino to get to it. There might be a back door.”
Kat nodded. “Yep. That would make sense. They’d need another exit in case of fire.”
“So, let’s go and find out.” Kyle stepped out of the car, closely followed by Kat, and they crossed the busy road to the casino|No sign of life ahead in either direction so she stayed straight, and continued along her path.

She then heard the sound of a motorcycle coming up from behind her. It's loud revving sound, reminded her of something, but she couldn't put her fingers on it. The noise made her feel safe, but she didn't know why. It was almost as if she expected someone to come and rescue her on a motorcycle|The other, in a green dress several sizes too big for her slight frame, muttered something he didn't understand, and leant forwards to ruffle his hair. 'Two two.' She held up two fingers. 'Very nice time. Two two.' Initially, he had ordered them both another drink. It had taken him several minutes to understand what she was suggesting. Then he shook his head, even when she reduced the price to almost a third of the original amount|Dale had cut away the remaining ropes and tape but didn't have a key for the handcuffs. "Did you see a key?" he asked her.

Isabelle shook her head. She didn't look good. "I need to throw up. Help me to the bathroom."

"Keith fed her a bunch of pills," said Dale|Joan made a reminder in her comm to check into the mystery of the alien ship’s pilots.
As they were slowing to a stop, Sally hesitantly cleared her throat before speaking. “Joan? I was wondering if you noticed anything ‘off’ about Adrian lately?”
“What do you mean ‘off|`My father passed away three years ago and he left me some money,' said Bergitta.

`Bergitta had been frugal with her money for years, so this ship is something of a rare extravagance,' said Angeline.

`Had I been frugal?'

`Frugal in the sense that you used to toss hundreds around without a care, but now you toss thousands around without a care in refurbishing an old rust bucket,' said Angeline|The IV drip, I mean."

He shook his head, grinning, but then got serious. "You seem okay. I was worried about you. You're just so ... young, to be involved in all this stuff."

"I'm all right. And I'm really--"

"Not that young|She started to pack up all her belongings when the train came to a screeching halt. The lights started flickering on and off on the train as the conductor came back on the loud speaker, "Everyone must get off the train. I repeat, get off the train now."

She didn't know if this was a normal loudspeaker notice, or if something was wrong with the train|As soon as the light flickered on, it revealed a regal, throne-like chair sitting in the middle of the room, right in line-of-sight of the door. Luminaria was sitting on top of it, Anna’s nicest silk scarf in tattered shreds at her feet.
“Oh really?” She groaned as she walked forward and grabbed the scarf|"What's he upset about?"

"Davey didn't only bring the magazines, he also brought stories, likely heard at home, about you and me and Fiona."

Bella's brows drew together and Fiona glided so much closer she nearly drifted into Bella.

"What stories about you and me and Fiona|We need to be careful because there was a cave-in when the geologists were up here." But he was turning. Going into the tunnel on the left.

Kyle's light swept into the interior. He saw the heavy veil of rocks, where it looked like part of the ceiling and wall had fallen in.

Gingerly, the group made their way past the rocks|His eyes were burning as though lit by an internal flame. The glowing orbs bore into her. She felt like they could see right through her. The figure took a step forwards...
And Tome appeared. He stepped up to the figure, and flung the contents of his pouch of revelation powder into its face. The moment the powder made contact, there was light|It lunged and almost tore off my hand. Mocha didn’t recognize me. 
“Mocha, what have they done to you?” I whispered.
I was forced closer still. I did not want to look, so I shut my eyes tight. Rouscher continued to push me toward the lion. I could hear the students in the audience as they joined in and cheered me on, urging me to hit the lion|I can only see his school bag dumped next to the table. There are no pictures or anything that suggests a family lives here. Is he alone? My heart breaks for him. Surely there is no way someone would allow their 17 year old to fend for themselves?

“Hey” his voice fills the room. “I have a few things which are all going to be too big, but at least you'll be warm|"But if that's what you need, I'll do it. Do you understand? I'll do anything you need me to do. Because I have never felt like this about anything, and I'm terrified of screwing up and losing it."

Zane held his breath, meeting Ty's eyes. "He's your best friend, Ty|After he’d emptied his pockets, Harry saw a set of keys on the table but knew none of them was the right size to fit the lock on the trap door. “Search him,” she said to Tom.
As Tom patted him down, he stopped at Minden’s front pocket. “Give me what’s in that pocket|Since she was the other person, she balled up her fist, threw a punch-and didn't come anywhere close to hitting him.

"Lucivar and I will bring Rainier and the children to the Coach. Can you handle Surreal?" Daemon asked.

"Don't need to be handled," Surreal muttered.

"Do you really want Lucivar to help you into the Coach|"His Majesty has given me strict instructions to lie down for a while."

Mikhail gave her a fierce scowl. "Then do so immediately, Shea. You are not in labor, are you? I will call Francesca and Gregori to examine you."

"I'm a doctor, Mikhail," Shea reminded him, "I'd know if I was in labor|"One of the few places we've found that has an abundance of surface water on this planet," Bax explained.  "That blue-white star of a sun bakes most everything else, but we're close to the coast now.  You should even get to see something more like a typical rainforest, maybe swing on a vine."
Lani laughed.  "Right, can't you see me on a vine|“It’s called being human.  No one is perfect.”
Margaret nodded.  “True.  But still, you can find a husband and I can’t.”
“What about Ethan?  Hasn’t he talked to you since the square dance?”
“Oh, he did.  He wanted to know if you were available|Ali had been obsessed with twins, for one thing-once, when Ali and Emily went shopping alone in Ardmore, Ali told everyone that they were twins, just to see how many people would believe them. And Ali used to marvel over how similar Emily and her sister Carolyn looked. "Has anyone ever thought you guys are twins|My veins throb as my eyes drink him in. His long, beautiful nose. His slender, assured arms. His pale skin is a few shades darker from the summer sun, and his black tattoo peeks out from underneath his T-shirt sleeve.

Joshua Wasserstein. My crush on him is near unbearable.

He looks up again, too, and I blush|“There’s really no place for you to sit,” said the other medic. “The only way in is on the gurney.”
“Can I walk over to the ambulance and get on it there?”
“Come on man it’s just a short ride, people do it every day.”
“Okay.”  Rick stood up and lay down on the gurney|Luckily, Emma knew the rules of Two Truths and a Lie; she and Alex and a couple of other girls had played it at a sleepover. Everyone took turns making three statements: one false, two true. Everyone else had to guess which was the lie. If they guessed correctly, the statement-tel er had to drink. If they guessed incorrectly, they had to drink|No terror, horror, or fear so deadly it made a man wrap up in himself and weep.

Elliot pushed open the door of the bedchamber, at the same time blowing out the candle. Moonlight spilled through the unshuttered window, a beam spreading over the bed in the middle of the room.

Juliana lay on her back in the bed, the covers pulled up to her chin, but she wasn't asleep|Except that before I could open my mouth to speak, I felt something push against my mind, against the protective mental wall, and it kept on pushing, searching, feeling.

It was Robert Mason, who was staring at me intently. The man was extremely psychic.

My thoughts were not closed to those who were psychic|And wouldn’t that just round off her day perfectly.
“Well, there aren’t any bathrooms on this floor,” said Donna, stepping through.
“Donna, every room has its own bathroom,” said Ronni. “Just ask to use Julia’s.”
“I don’t know Julia,” said Donna|Willow didn't know if it was the bluish tinge they give off, their unsettling intermittent blinking, or the odd hum that most people didn't even notice. She knew it was the lights that bothered him because it was the common link between the mall, the library, some classrooms and the grocery store. She had found that she tended to get migraines from them, and she worried that he was experiencing physical pain from the lights|We pelted down the path toward the Little Palace. Nikolai and the royal guards trailed behind us, slowed by his frail father.

At the entrance to the wooded tunnel, the King bent double, wheezing badly as the Queen wept and held tight to his arm.

"I have to get them to the Kingfisher," said Nikolai|But, clearly someone or something is yanking our chain and I refuse to sit by and continue being played the fool.”
“What if it really is a Wampus Cat?”  Freddie asked.
Bogdon thought for a minute.
“As Chief Scientist of the Granite Falls Rangers I can only answer one way:  So what?  So what if it’s a real Wampus Cat|Her face appeared in Logan's mind, as vivid and clear as if she were sitting next to him. She had a sweet face. Kind, amber eyes the color of autumn sunset. Not only was she lovely, she was obviously caring as well. Why else would she have stayed to help him at great risk to her own life?

"I won't do that," said Logan|Her face disappointed, Beullah put it back in her bag. Then over the next two hours, she went about explaining the psychology and toys of dominance to Rhea, whose head felt as if it were going to explode from information overload.

Just before lunch, Beullah decided to call it a day.

"I'll just head on back home," she said to Rhea|Now I have to learn to function in it as a normal person, free of medicinal depressants - step two.

I try explaining my situation to her - my nightmares won't ever go away, because the demons I saw were real - but she refuses to listen. Nobody believes me when I talk about the demons|Whether or not you want kids is an important part of any relationship. It can break it or bring it closer. I don't want it to break us.

There's something about being in the dark with him that makes me want to address my fears.

Taking in a deep breath, I say, "I'm not sure I can have kids|"It's been there for, like, three hundred years."

"That's what you're thinking about right now?" Nick said.

"How about how the hunters knew exactly where to find us?" Diana placed her hand gently on Nick's shoulder. "Hold on, we shouldn't jump to conclusions. We don't know for sure it was the hunters|# # # # # # # #
After the optimism of discovering new leads to follow at the previous night's meeting, a tired and discouraged band of Wilizy Warriors met for debriefing Wednesday night.
Doc and Granny had taken on the task of finding Franklin's church – their previous focus on health records being fruitless. Both reported that they had no idea how to find this church|A man in his forties, trim black hair, silver eyes. Save the eyes, dozens of people could have matched that description.
“That’s him,” Knight said a few minutes later, a jerk of his head indicating a man watching the pit.
“How can you be—”
“It’s him|Mercy had noticed, from reading the newspapers and magazines supplied by Maggie, that some rich women didn't seem to show their age like other women. 
A couple of rich ladies stopped by the orphanage every so often to drop off clothes and other donations from some of the churches. Mercy had occasionally spoken to them but she had never actually had a conversation with someone who was rich|My chest feels so tight from the anxiety squeezing it, I'm surprised I'm still breathing.

"I made a promise." Nyelle's whisper barely cuts through the rain.

She stops in front of me at the edge of the forest with the cabin in sight, her hands clenched tight.

"Do you still have to keep the promise|No, actually, it was not a leaf at all. “Philbert, this is mistletoe.”
“Yes, Your Grace.”
“I do not need mistletoe, Philbert.”
“Of course not, Your Grace.” But he held the mistletoe out to her nonetheless.
“Philbert, I do not want the mistletoe|" Now it was Wanda's turn to groan, but I ignored it. I slammed the trapdoor shut.

"Hey!" came a muffled yell from the dun- geon. "Help me shove the safe over the trapdoor so he can't get out, " I said. "You can't do that, " said Wanda|I gave her a look that said, “Are you kidding me!”
“Of course. What would you like me to say?” I asked clicking my pen and looking into her eyes.
“How about ‘Claire, believe in a true love. Your friend, Torie.’”
“I think I can manage that,” I replied and inscribed it as she requested with an embellished “Claire” and “Torie|We sat in the kitchen and ate dinner.  It was the last day Amara and Emily would be together. The next morning we were going to a small town that Sariel thought would be safe. We didn’t know for how long but we all hoped it would be short. Amara was trying to be strong and so was Emily|“A matter of health?” Malin was astounded.
“Yes, his, if he had only known.”
Malin laughed, delighted. “And if they inquire more closely?”
“Good manners means you never have to say more than you wish. Just smile and repeat in a melancholy voice, ‘Yes, a matter of health|“What else did you bring?”
“I wanted English muffins, but the best I could do was lots of toast.  We have both white and wheat.  And jelly.  Let’s see, we have grape, and grape, and another grape….it seems we have any flavor you want, as long as it’s grape|'What's the curly thing?' she said.

'Oh, that's the Adjustable Device for Winning Ontological Arguments,' said Shawn. 'The King asked for it.'

'Works, does it?'

'Er... if you twiddle it properly.'

'And this?'

'That's the Tool for Extracting the Essential Truth from a Given Statement,' said Shawn|"I don't think we have moth's chance in a crow's nest of getting into the Library with this," said Teria. She tried not to smirk, and failed miserably.
"He wants to speak with us today. It took all the strings I could pull to get the last permit. Think we can claim official business a second time?"
"Doubtful. I think Professor Morintopealos is going to have to come save us from the librarian again," said Teria|There are a lot of places to hide there, a lot of buildings we can sneak into, and there might be weapons still there or maybe even food."

"I don't know the base very well," one man said.

"The aliens could be out there," another woman replied. "Wouldn't it make sense for them to take over that place, and use it as their own?"

I couldn't argue with that, it would make sense, but I doubted the aliens were on the base|I think at some point I'm going to have to just live with the fact that he's going to be a shut-in."

"I know how he feels." Nicole spills the words before she can stop herself.

"How's that? You have dementia, sweetie? You seem a little young for that."

Nicole smiles without humor. "No, I don't have dementia|Laquita walked back into the room carrying a large bag of mixed vegetables. "I don't remember you being so klutzy."
Gracie laughed even though she sensed maybe the slightest edge to Laquita's innocent words. Then again, she might have been guilty of that herself.
"No ice," Laquita said, kneeling down in front of Gracie|“Hello, sweetheart,” he said. “I thought I'd come up and get you out of bed for breakfast but I see you're already up.”
Once again Matilda suddenly remembered that time had stood still while she was away on her adventure and it was still morning at home.
“I was a bit bored in bed so I thought I'd get up and do a bit of reading before breakfast,” said Matilda|"I like simple dresses that are figure flattering, pants that are comfortable yet flattering, and I like bright colors along with basic black pieces."

"Okay, that gives me a general idea of what to pull for you, and what about the style of dresses? Do you prefer a dress with sleeves or without sleeves?"

"I really don't have a preference, I like all kinds of dresses|"Jaenelle and Marian must have moved it so they could attach this illusion spell to the gate and still leave some open ground where visitors can gather."

"Maybe getting a face full of cobwebs is meant to discourage people from going farther?" He sounded like he'd be quite happy to be discouraged from going farther.

"Are you telling me an Opal-Jeweled Warlord Prince is going to be put off by a few cobwebs|The best that I could do was try to sneak away when he wasn’t looking and attempt to perform the exorcism, but chances are the prince would get to me anyway.
I kept my braining running on the thought that the prince had waited 50 years to start bringing the ghosts back. It doesn’t make any sense, but then again, I had never heard of a ghost gathering other ghosts. It was also weird that he was able to touch the ghosts|Vrrrrrrrrrrooooooooooommmm…
“Don’t touch it.” Raife turns on his feet slowly, looking oap into the buildings and all around him at the same time. The wallet is just lying there, its smooth leather calling attention, but to no one other than Raife. He moves forward slowly, sinks lower to the ground by bending his knees slightly, and stares more closely at the wallet|"I think so," said Dwight, who moved gracefully under a table, motioning the others to follow him.
Khalil positioned himself, putting his hands on the bottom of the nearest table as the vibrations intensified. "Do we even have earthquakes here? I don't remember one.”
"We do, just not often," said Dwight|Many questions bobbled around her head as she tried her best to comprehend what the man was doing. She received another shock as a funny light gathered around the man's hand. Was she seeing this right?
This new light didn't last long, as suddenly, a lollipop appeared! The little girl's eyes brightened as she looked at the lollipop|She ordered lunch for them from room service and laid her phone on the table between them. She explained that she would be asking him background questions about the motel operations and what he knew about the insured. This statement would be used for the insurance investigation only. She added that the FBI would take another statement once they found out he was back. He said he understood and she turned on the recorder|Jim's gaze fixed on me. "How well?"

"Well enough," Curran said. "He's scared of her."

"Did he ever see you fighting?" Andrea asked.

"Yes. A long time ago."

"How long?" Jim asked. "How well does he know how you fight|He used to say that educated people don’t believe in faeries anymore. Is that what you think?”
“Well,” Aaron replied, picking his words carefully. “I’ve never seen a faerie before.” 
“Just because you haven’t seen one doesn’t mean they don’t exist,” she retorted. “Dragons exist, so why not faeries|Between our heroes and the Laikans were a number of trenches where a collection of archaeologists and tourists hid.
“Cover Jimmy and me to the trench and then we’ll cover you. We’ve got to get to Milk,” Chase commanded.
“OK,” brought back Julianna.
“Don’t hit the ruins,” pleaded Dr. Hendricks.
“Well that goes without saying,” replied Chase|Mareth called a dinner break and passed around food. The fireflies ate with gusto, even though they had just been fed.

After everyone had eaten, Mareth lowered the sails in his boat and hooked the front of his craft to the back of Howard's with a towrope. "Howard and I will take turns sailing the lead boat while the rest sleep|Mr. Dawsley rose up as well and left the room, though he headed up to his bedroom. That night I dined alone in the mansion. Mr. Dawsley had been in his room for a couple of hours and I was worried about him. Ellie had yet to return as Dawsley had predicted she would. I felt slight tinges of worry about the fate of Ellie|The murmur of the television and people chatting gives her a sense of happy security as she walks down the hallway. When Helen sees her, she gets on her feet.

"I'm going to get going." Helen reaches behind her and takes her purse off the back of a nearby chair.

Nicole walks over to stand in front of Helen|Here Arbid was, talking for the first time ever, and his mother didn’t know if he was talking to her or to the bear. Maybe both. It didn’t matter; she stopped—and so did the bear!
Arbid smiled—something else he had never done—and looked at his mother. Another first! “See?” he said before turning back to face the bear|Tyana added one last point, just to emphasise their superiority, "You will note that those we allow you to control will simply land. Those we do not, we will cause to explode in a way you have never seen before!"
  Long before Marcus's minute was up the wall was lined with people looking towards the Oak tree. Marcus pointed to where he knew the ship to be, and then at the tree|The others had moved away from the door as the cogs started spinning even faster, and Jude suddenly realized their purpose. The faster these cogs spun, the further the door opened. 
The problem was, now, Jude didn’t want the door to open.
“Let’s get back to the lift,” Jude said. 
The others didn’t move. 
“I said let’s get back to the lift|Hearing the rattle of wheels, he turned and watched Heather push a cart up to the checkout counter. The Lakeside Courtyard supplied goods to all the terra indigene living in the surrounding wild country. What HGR had lacked in human customers lately was more than balanced by the number of book orders sent in from all the settlements.

"You going to work on the orders|"You know, another couple of years in my location and I could have bought my house from you-"

He held up one hand. "I've offered to make you a deal."

"I don't need special deals, Kevin. You know I want to do this myself."

"Yeah, I know."

Reaching across the table to give his hand a pat, Bella said, "I really do appreciate that you want to help me buy the place, Kevin|I want to tell you some things about your inquiry yesterday, but I need to do it face to face. How about lunch?”
“Okay, where?”
“Someplace open with background noise, how about fast food in the Pentagon Atrium, my treat, at one o’clock?”
“Yes, fine.  But you’re coming to me, so my treat|Ginger was tending to a steaming pot while Alexander sat cleaning his rifle.
	“Good work Leopold. I've got news, come with me.” He walked into the middle of the camp and stood by the fire.
	“Aright captain? anything new happening out in the wastes?” Alexander said sarcastically with a bit of a smirk, he knew that nothing ever happened in the wastes|“Why are you bringing that?” asked Ava, “They have pillows at the camp.”
“But this is my pillow, and I can’t get to sleep without it. If you two want me to go camping, I must have my creature comforts. By the way, did I tell you I don’t like camping|"Oh yes," he added, seeing Laurence's surprise, "the Tsar decided he would not throw a good army after bad, in the end, and perhaps that he did not want to spend the rest of his life as a French prisoner; there is an armistice, and they are negotiating a treaty in Warsaw, the two Emperors, as the best of friends." He gave a bark of laughter. "So you see, they may not bother getting us out; by the end of this month I may be a citoyen myself."

He had only just escaped the final destruction of Prince Hohenlohe's corps, having been ordered to Danzig by courier to secure the fortress against just such a siege|The barking howl of a bloodhound suddenly shattered the serenity of the early morning quiet. They were being tracked.

Grinly’s bruised eye had turned from black to a garish purple. He hated Petr, and for as little a reason as elbowing him into the face while trying to escape on that first day. He hated Kassim for knocking him out the night they had both escaped|Kiyu and Jacks worked their way along the other side, cursing when they found a dud and shouting when another robot powered up. We moved between dozens of robots, more than half the hangar. Twenty of the machines turned on, though three of these only sputtered for a moment before going dark once more. But time was starting to worry me, so I went to the center of the hangar|Then he picked up another brick from the box and pressed it down on top of the half-completed chimney. Two more bricks followed squarely on top of the first before he discovered how hungry he was and turned to signal his craving. He caught Elsie’s eye and then looked around for a plate or something to tell he was hungry. He didn’t find anything, nothing at all that looked like food|Every time he tried to yank the branches away, more would come and grasp a hold of him.    
Then, all of a sudden, a winged creature appeared to be flying towards the hut, and the Hunter was making his way towards Charlie and Rocky as well.    
Rocky stopped what he was doing as he realized the Hunter was less than twenty feet away from him and Charlie|“Ooh, it looks like you’ve found me then.”
Boris nodded.  “Aye, that we have.  We're hoping you might know where we can find some red tickets?”
“Tickets?” Jakob asked, reaching slowly into his trouser pocket to make sure his ticket was still there. “No, I haven’t seen any tickets|He guided her inside, barely touching her except for his grip on her hand, but the heat from his body hovered and invaded her until she leaned into his side, wanting that wonderful jolt of awareness all over again.

Conversation stopped when she and Dillon re-entered the living room, and once again there was open speculation on the faces of the Colters.

Seth's gaze dropped to her and Dillon's linked hands. His expression remained neutral, but his eyes told a different story. There was uncertainty there, and forgetting that Dillon was going to inform him that she was taking a ride with him, she dropped Dillon's hand and went straight to Seth|“Why not have horses or cattle pull the wagons?” another man asked.
“We felt the food and supplies would be far more valuable for now,” Fanchon replied. “In time we will have horses and cattle. I see you are nearly ready to put wood beams across to the other side. We could start cutting trees to make the beams|The dean could feel his head beginning to throb again and chills broke out on his arms. My fever’s getting worse, he thought.

“We have some trespassers on the grounds, sir,” Boyd said, searching for the right words.

The dean’s concern quickly turned to aggravation once again.

“Boyd, tell me you didn’t wake me up just to let me know we have trespassers|The day before Corey had spent the afternoon photographing all of the artwork in what they called the ‘staging area’ of the warehouse. This was a corner room of the warehouse that was draped in beige fabric where each new piece coming into the gallery was photographed. These pictures were primarily used for inventory purposes at the gallery; professional shots would be taken at a later date and used to build a catalog|He had not had the time, with him being busy concentrating on extending his kingdom and raiding nearby settlements owned by other kingdoms. Now he stood wondering what would become of his empire if he were to die without an heir to take in his footsteps.
‘You seem troubled sire,’ Raphael, his most faithful aide and servant said.
‘A rare sight, isn’t it Raphael|"So glad you could join us."

Renna's gaze snapped to the figure standing beside him, and her arm lowered on its own account.

FOURTEEN

The very doctor Renna had trusted with her life stepped further into the warehouse, a soft smile on her face. "I'm glad to see I wasn't wrong about you, Renna|In fact, I have to get up early in the morning and go to work. I'll leave a note here with my phone number on it. Why don't you use the computer in the study to send your folks an E-mail? The password is on a slip of pink paper in the drawer."

"The study? The room with all the windows and books|At the back, or stern, of the ship was a building that looked to Dylan a bit like a small house. Everyone was going in there and Dylan and his Dad followed.
Inside was a room with windows and a large table in the centre. All around the walls were bookcases or maps on the walls. Everyone took a chair, but Dylan walked over to look at the maps|Some holding hands some just standing and talking. You could hear the birds singing and chirping from the trees. There were families sitting at the picnic tables and cooking out on the fire pits. There were blankets on the ground with some people talking and some people tanning. Over by the trees was a man with a camera with a huge lens taking pictures of the birds|I felt the same way when Calvin found me at the cabin. I was dehydrated and I saw things that weren't real. I thought Calvin was Shaun."

"Get the police!"I screamed. "For once, just do what I say! This has nothing to do with me and Calvin|What could the meeting be about? There might have been an accident, or a crash.

She turned on the radio to see if it was on the news. She got a talk station, a caller saying, " - not fair to make kids wear uniforms to school. It's elitist and discriminatory - "

Casey pushed a button, changing the station|I explained our situation, as if each team member didn't already realize it, that we were only eleven military personnel. We had no way of fighting the Ebens. We did not come 40 light years to start a war with the Ebens. A war we could not win. We could not even win a simple fist fight with the Ebens|Together we moved out of the cover of the trees, eyes searching the shrubbery for movement, the ground for tracks. There was nothing.

Jessie made for the entrance. I grabbed her arm and she scowled, tugged, but I shook my head. I was going in first.

I held out my hand for the flashlight that hung from her utility belt. She stuck out her tongue, but she gave me the flashlight|I pull out my flashlight and cup my hand around the lens. With my other hand, I balance the object on my blade as I lower my face towards the flashlight. I form a compartment to contain the light and turn my lab light on the specimen. I fight the putrid syrupy stink while categorizing the content. I finally figure out what it is; and I knew I know this smell|Cuvier agonized over these dug-up bones, but he finally concluded that God or no God, many animals had become extinct - as a result, he thought, of worldwide catastrophes, like Noah's flood."

"Okay..."

"So Cuvier reluctantly came to believe in extinction," Malcolm said, "but he never accepted evolution. In Cuvier's mind, evolution didn't occur. Some animals died and some survived, but none evolved|She had a task to complete before she gave in to her grief.
She surveyed the area and began to gather up rocks, the largest she could carry. She piled them on top of the two dead men, hoping to protect their bodies from wild animals. A poor burial, but the best she could manage. She worked steadily, moving farther and farther away to gather the rocks|Like her mother said, occasions where you had to prove your worth and beauty were not fit for a person like her.

"I don't think I should be here," she said.

He spun and glared at her. "You're supposed to be here. You're my wife."

At the present she sure did not feel like much of a wife|There was no paper on the front porch, but Cassie did find Adam, curled up beneath his jacket, asleep on the porch swing. She watched him for a moment. How peaceful he looked, but he couldn't be comfortable. His long legs and arms were pretzeled into the swing, hanging halfway off. He'd probably been there all night.

This boy really loves me, Cassie thought to herself, looking down on his beautifully sculpted body, crunched as it was within the confines of the swing|While Moffat was on the phone, Mrs. Grubb made a second call. She asked Joyce Bithell for any information she might have. Although Aaron did seem quite normal and in excellent spirits by Wednesday, the staff of the Psychiatric Ward was equally surprised by his sudden release. Nurse Bithell believed that the psychiatrist was responsible. When Mrs. Grubb relayed the nurse’s account to Moffat, he asked her to phone her friend once again, to set up an urgent meeting with the psychiatrist|Eric said.

'No,' the man said.

HE SHOULD RECEIVE SOME CASH SETTLEMENT FOR THE WATCH IN ADDITION TO THE MEDICATION

The flashing box, declaring its message, was extended by the female reeg toward the man; he halted, frowning, then shrugged. 'One hundred in cash,' he said to Eric|I will suffer no more lies from you."

"I haven't lied." The edge of the desk bit into the back of her thigh just under the crease of her bottom. "I'm only the courier. I know nothing about the contents of the envelope."

He leaned forward, trapping her between his body and the desk|And still stay straight enough to average 100-plus miles per hour. I e-mailed the file to you.” Tom handed the manila folder to Bob and gave a two finger cub scout salute before walking out. Bob had never seen Tom mock his superiors before, and wondered if Tom was becoming as frustrated as he was. Bob rolled his eyes back and half-heartedly raised his arm straight forward, fingers together, palm out, in a much more demonic, and satiric, salute|It was larger than his-well, the one his dad threw away-and was covered in a white and purple bedspread that had a cascade of ruffles on the skirt.

Trystan turned back to her, an eyebrow rising on his face in surprise, "Ruffles? Really?"

She shrugged, "What's wrong with ruffles|Your shoulder – where are your clothes?”
Yeah – you forgot that part, right? But nope. That was me, new zombie, no clothes.
So what else could I do but reach out, grab my landlord, pull him in, and start chewing.
Yeah. Sorry about this, but man, he was simply delicious|I hadn’t exactly been a good girl.”
“I don’t know what you are saying,” said Tuan. “I see a perfect girl in front of me, perfect in every way, perfect for anybody.”
Zoe smiled. Tuan was emboldened. He took a deep breath and said, “I love you, Zoe|How old were you when you were transformed?

Thirty. He slanted a nervous glance her way. Ye couldna guess? Do I look much older?

She looked indignant. I wouldnt presume to judge.

His jaw shifted. He was sorely tempted to poke her or tickle her. Then kiss her senseless. Actually, he could skip the tickling and go straight to the kissing|As if drawn against her will, the duchess slowly turned her head to look full at the portrait. She moved closer. Her hand hovered near, but without touching the bottom of the gilded frame. Miranda noticed that the slender fingers shook ever so slightly. "Yes. They were indeed alike."
The older woman gave herself a slight shake, as if it took great effort for her to remove her attention from the portrait and turn her gaze to Miranda|They may be in the same building as you."

"Great. Where are you?" Grant said. "We're in the lodge."

Grant said, "And the others? Muldoon, everybody else?"

"We've lost a few people. But we got everybody else over to the lodge|But she was tired and out of shape. She slowed her pace a little and they jogged side by side until they reached the station.
The station had been evacuated and there were no trains leaving that day. Jakob took across the tracks and down the hill to the service booth. A small dirt road ran a little ways away and then descended through a tunnel in the next hill|He was not supposed to be angry and hurt and Ty all understanding and apologetic, making him feel like a caveman for being upset.

After checking the directory sign outside baggage claim, Zane found the baggage conveyor for his flight and stood waiting for his black leather duffel to scroll past. Ty stood at his side, silent and close. Zane could feel him. He took a steadying breath and turned to look at Ty|"We share blood; we're connected in that way. I would know if that connection was severed."

A small chill ran through Cassie as she thought over Annabelle's words. "So you would know if something happened to Devon also," she said softly.

Annabelle's eyes were kind and understanding as she turned to Cassie|Jisei said, “You are still not listening, and have I not told you to strap on your helmet.”  She bent down, picked it up, and then added it to the sack.  “It shall not protect your head if it falls off.”
“Yes, you have many times, and I'm listening|“Where could our father come that his armies would not be noticed so much and where it would not cause an international catastrophe?”
	“The mountain,” Noah spoke simply. 
	“Yes, the mountain,” answered Samlazaz and Araklba together.

	They all answered together, “The mountain|Maybe I could get some names of women he…” He stopped, realizing he was thinking out loud. “Okay, I’ll see what I can do but I can’t make any promises.” Tony looked up at Maria and still saw anguish in her eyes. “You’re going to be okay, Maria|“How about opening your own clinic?”
He shook his head. “All my money wouldn’t be enough to fund it. Plus the logistics are beyond comprehension. That’s why we’ve looked into working for an established clinic.”
“Do you really want to volunteer your time?”
“I might like to work at UB’s clinic|Boys, you must keep the shop clean, not fight, and do exactly what I say. Romero!"
"Yes, Master," Hansum answered, running to his side.
"I'm thinking that you might be able to learn to mount the lenses in their frames."
"I'm sure I could, Master|Sharma flushed and retorted, 'We will deal with the situation when it arises.' On the surface, Sharma looked calm and controlled. However, Jina knew him well enough to see that he was edgy with excitement and anticipation. Jina saw that Sharma sensed that the time when he would become king of united Kerina was near at hand. However, to be fair to Sharma, Jina knew that he wasn't just excited at the thought that he would soon be king|As sincerely as I've ever asked for anything in my life, I want you to do this for me. There's a group I've met that are a lot like me and they're planning to break out and head for Denver later today. I'm going with them."

He paused, and it took every bit of Thomas's resolve to keep quiet. Why would they want to break out and go to Denver|JULIAN'S fingers had long ago lost all feeling, and the tingling sensation was marching its way down his arm toward his shoulder by the time the snow got heavy enough that the two FBI agents were discussing stopping.

"I think we can make it out of the storm," Zane was saying even as Ty shook his head.

"I'm telling you, Zane, if there's one thing West Virginia knows, it's snow|cried Sheila, who just landed on top of the building as well.    
Both Charlie and the dragon turned to face Sheila.  The dragon looked confused.    
“Sheila,” responded Charlie.    
“So which one of us do you want to blow smoke rings at first?” interrogated Sheila.    
Nightwing first turned back to Charlie, who kept his sword raised, then back to Sheila|I told no one about any of it, not even my mother, who even through her own grief was more concerned about my wellbeing, than her own.

That was the main reason I didn't cry. I didn't want her to know how badly I was damaged, how haunted and tormented I was. I wanted her to believe that I was strong, that I would be ok|When she looked back up at Liz, though, she tilted her head and furrowed her brow. "What's this about? You okay?"

"Yeah, I'm fine," she croaked. She wasn't hiding anything from her best friend.

"I mean, it's just a dress, Liz. I think it looks great." The look on Victoria's face made it all too clear to Liz that Victoria knew it wasn't the dress|“I guess this was as an opportune time for Blue to tell you about my old habits.”
“You mean the drugs?” 
I nodded. “Yeah, the drugs.” 
He moved closer. “Would you be upset if I said I already know everything about you?”
“But I never told you about the drugs|They had to go overboard and use a fancy, custom-made miniature version of their house. Now the post leaned sideways like the Tower of Pisa, with red paint from my car all over the white pole. Their mailbox was totaled, the mail scattered on the ground.
Someone called out something, but I was busy imagining Mr. Peterson’s reaction when he saw his mailbox|Anyone could say anything about that baby, who's gonna say no? Nobody knows nothing except me." That was a real conversation stopper, and it got the attention of almost everyone in the room.

The silence was broken by Karl Bagosian's entrance through the kitchen porch. I was so surprised to see him, I involuntarily said, "Where'd you come from, Karl|Just thinking that Phil was up there with his girl made him see red… Yes, she was his girl and no one else’s… But why had it taken another guy showing up for him to admit it? Melissa was right: he was a cliché.
Phil was apparently staying for more than five minutes, so Scott got out his cell phone and called Tyler to meet him at a bar downtown.
“Take it easy driving over there, Scott|It was your typical fairytale well, a stone circle built around a hole with a pole-lifted wooden roof and a pail hanging from a rope. However, this was no normal well. The waters within twirled, loud and tumultuously. No one drank from this well. No one pulled water from its depths. Only those in desperate emotional pain came to the well|Disappointed that the view from below the normal water level offered nothing interesting, he turned to climb back up the slimy stone slope. As he did so, for just an instant, his eyes passed over the far side of the open plaza – one of a dozen in the city – and he saw something he never noticed before. It was a tiny glimpse of framework just over the top of one building|He made her feel strong and special with a few words. After feeling guilty for so long, of wondering if she could hold it all together for Kolby, she welcomed the reassurance coursing through her veins as surely as the current underneath her.

Tony slid from his board and ducked under. She watched through the clear surface as he freed the ankle leash attaching him to his board|The thick heavy chains keeping him a prisoner, rattled violently before being flung to the ground. For a fleeting moment Haleton thought he’d been freed. Instead, his feet were glued to the ground preventing him from running.
Particles from the net of light the orb emitted started to make him feel warm. He watched a rogue particle of light float down from the orb|We also can’t free Blue ourselves because we’re not Vemreaux.”
Liam looked insulted. “I don’t need money. My dad’s the emperor, remember? I just don’t have a servant on principle, but my family employs a few. 
Sam threw his head back. “I’m totally telling Josephine you called her a servant|. Yes, yes, your boobies are nice. Settle down.

"How did it go with the Reapers?" I asked.

Saiman glanced at Jim. "Less than satisfactory."

"The Order has a certain interest in the Reapers." Technically that was true. I was an agent of the Order and I had an interest in the Reapers|The room went quiet, except for the clink of shot into the bowl, and Spike's grunts of pain. Ella stood up and walked to her grandson, and Myka took her place next to Jordan on the sofa.

"Spike, I'm sorry," Ella said. "I couldn't protect him."

Spike turned his head and reached out a hand to Ella|"We need him alive, so he will not be harmed. We are fitting a silver collar around his neck. I believe that will keep him from shifting. If not, we will have to keep him tranquilized until we can bring him to the Master."

"What will the Master do to him?"

"The real question is what will the cat shifter do to the Master|Will placed his hands on the table, leaning on them and looked up. “We need to summon Eva.”
Stubbs leaned forward in his chair, appearing shocked at Will’s words. “We don’t even know when the last time she Scattered was.”
“If I’m back, then she is too,” Will said, turning his attention to Stubbs|she screamed, as Joseph grabbed onto her ankle and didn’t let go.
Slowly, he dragged her a couple of feet toward deeper water, before relinquishing his grip.  As she scrambled to get away, he momentarily grabbed her other ankle, creating even more panic.
At about the same time, Sharianna grabbed Cameron, who also panicked|“What?”
“You look like Antares when he doesn’t get to terrorize some poor defenseless animal.”
Shawna grinned, but didn’t answer.
“So if it’s not that traitor swooning over you with a rose in his mouth, then what is it?”
“He’s not swooning, and he’s not a traitor|Kezmin moved closer to her son and looked at him as only a mother can, and spoke, "Something troubles you, Azarias. I can see it more every day. You are not yourself. Perhaps if we could talk . . ."
"Mother, I told you I am fine.” Azarias responded with the slightest bit of irritation in his voice. Then, he thought better of his tone, and his shoulders dropped as he added, "I'm sorry, Mother|I don't know how to be a mother and you don't know how to be a father." She pauses as if she just realized something. "We're going to be a total wreck as parents, aren't we?"

"Hey." I cup her cheeks with my hands, forcing her to stare into my eyes. She blinks up at me, looking lost and worried and in desperate need of reassurance|“Do not swear, Cassius,” chided Mr. Gatt. “It’s a sign of a weak mind and an undisciplined tongue.” 
Casey looked was taken aback. “Sorry.” 
"Monson's winning of the Horum Vir scholarship was something of a surprise," continued Mr. Gatt. "The Induction ceremony was canceled because the board was unsure whether Monson was going to claim the scholarship|“That’s because you’re an adult, and I’m not. But just you wait, I’ll be taller yet!”
“I know you will. Where’s Daman?”
“He’s inside with Dad. They’re packing up a bag. He has a new magic trick to show you.” Leon laughed as he spoke about his brother; he got a kick out of Daman trying to be a magician|"Yeah," said the doctor, and grinned again.

Sunny kept surfacing to consciousness, like a float bobbing up and down in the water. At first her awareness was fragmented. She could hear voices in the distance, though she couldn't make out any words, and a soft beeping noise. She was also aware of something in her throat, though she didn't realize it was a tube|“Excuse me, can I have one more cigarette?”, I asked, interrupting his monologue. 
“Of course.” He handed me the crumpled pack, and I started to pull out a second cigarette. After a moment, I was sitting back and inhaling the smoke, and he continued his musings. 
“For example, if I didn’t use to spend nights reading by flashlight, perhaps I wouldn’t have devoted my life to writing|“Settlements?” 
“Small and scattered,” Davenport replied. “The area with the most settlements is in the northern hemisphere, near a chain of mountains that runs through the center of the largest continent.”
“Excellent. Send those coordinates to the pilot. Mr. Freely, plot a descent course that will bring us down in that general vicinity, but at least a dozen kilometers from any of the settlements|I pulled her towards me and stroked her hair as we cuddled.

A few minutes later there was a knock on the door and we both froze.

"Who is it?" I called out.

"It's me, daddy." Harry ran into the room and jumped onto the bed and sprawled over the duvet.

"You can't just barge in the bedroom, Harry|“A pad won’t hide the smell as much.”
“Gross! I don’t smell! And what gives? I just finished my period last week.”
“It’s not a period,” the redhead said. “It’s you coming into season.”
“Coming into—”
“You’re in heat|He has to fold in on himself, his long, gangly limbs poking out in sharp angles. His arms are starting to turn hard and sinewy, but in this moment he's a child, shaking, cowering almost. Jared is loading the car. Jamie would not show this fear if he were here. Jamie wants to be brave, to be like Jared|I felt everyone's eyes on me while I read it."

I take a few breaths, forcing myself to continue. "It was a love letter. A love letter from me that I didn't write. It was made out to Billy. Everyone had a copy. They were all holding them, reading and laughing at all the things they thought I said to Billy|He turned around and saw the camp counselor wave goodbye to a tall black man and a petite, presumably Vietnamese, woman.
Vo Nguyen walked up to the saltwater pools when Ivan was putting away the cleaning equipment.
“I see a big smile on your face. Are you seeing your girlfriend later?” said Vo.
“She is not my girlfriend, Mr. Nguyen,” said Ivan|He sobbed wordlessly, sickened by the searing pain. 
At the same time, an unbearable lightness flooded him. Balkind did catch! I'm not dead. I'm not dead! Balkind caught me. 'I'm alive!' He snorted the three syllables. Hawked, spat, and tried again: 'I'm alive|She watched her mother's message three more times in the upstairs common room. Marron stayed with her, patting her knee and making soft comforting sounds.

She looked down at the handkerchief wadded in her hand. Her heart ached, like it was ripping inside of her. The pain only seemed to get worse.

"It happened in Ag 6," she said to Marron|“That a man would want to kiss you? You are a beautiful woman, Your Grace.”
“Rowena,” she whispered, wanting to hear her name on his tongue.
“Rowena.” He did not disappoint. His lips wrapped around her name, his voice making her shiver. “May I tell you a secret, Rowena|I have half a mind to allow him in, if only to see how far his boldness will go."

If Bridget hadn't still been holding her breath, she might have had the sense to protest. But her mind was hazy, and she was still busy trying to sort out what Francis had said.

With a predatory glint in her eye, Aunt Latissia ordered the butler, "Show him in, Francis|The droning stopped and the large steel doors rolled
open before him, he walked from the elevator and stood
in the corridor, looking left and right for Suite 5C. He
spied an informa-tion board on the wall immediately to
the left of the elevator doors, positioning himself in front
of it; he scanned the business names for Lowman and
Beaumont. Ben took in the instructions to find the
accountants and turned away from the board|The water lilies darted past the carriage and stood shoulder to shoulder guarding the portal entrance. “Show them your shield, Angus,” Fane commanded. “Put it up against the window where they can see it.
The shield pulled hard in his hands and Angus fought to keep control of it. He wrestled it to the window. One fat water lily scowled and swam to the side window, studying the shield|“Yeah right. Like we’d waste our time with that flea bag.”
I stepped between them and the cat. Scott and I had known each other since elementary school, and if I knew one thing about him, it was how to tell when he was lying. “This is low, even for you, Scott|But her stated assumption that Carrie was married and that it was her husband who was connected to Tom only proved how unworldly she was.
“My son and I went to the gravesite,” Carrie pointedly responded. Since Tommy’s birth, she had considered herself an independent woman, working full-time and taking full responsibility for raising her child. “I’m a single mom,” Carrie said, motioning to Tommy|Horses whinnied as they heard him approach. He stopped by each stall, patting and stroking sleek coats. His brother, Seth, came out of the tack room.
“I see you got your letter,” he commented.
Dean nodded. “Jack was all wound up about it. I guess it’s because we don’t get a whole lot of mail|Two of the joggers left the track and walked up a few rows where they sat by themselves and stared at the field. They were in their early fifties, tanned and fit with expensive running shoes. "Guy on the right is Blanchard Teague," Paul said, anxious to prove he knew everyone. "Our optometrist. On the left is Jon Couch, a lawyer|Gripping the loaded pistol firmly in my hand, I run to the light, which now illuminates buildings, similar to the ones in my dream at the wind turbine farm. Cautiously approaching the buildings, I slow to a walk, and my heart races. Wind turbines hum above in the steady breeze.
The light is mounted to a wall, illuminating the nearby buildings and a third jeep. There’s no sign of movement or activity except the hum of the turbines|I examined it a little more closely, wiping away the remainder of my tears with the sleeve of my shirt. It was a recipe for a Russian cake. I carefully read the instructions. It was something that I had never seen before; a Russian Bird’s Milk Cake. At first glance, it seemed too difficult to attempt to bake. A note was attached to the back of the recipe|Adam Shaw placed another pack of explosives into the stone cutout in the tunnel. Where to go next? He should have made a map back to the museum lobby; the tunnels were never-ending. Somewhere in the distance, he heard footsteps. He clicked his lantern off.

He receded deeper into the burial chamber that lay just off the tunnel|After more elbowing and shoving, Sharma caught Jina’s eye and grinned. That ended the charade and they started laughing. Jina never could be angry with Sharma for long. It was always like that and, in spite of everything, it stayed like that for a long, long time until the business with Zaliek. 
Jina said, 'Hey, I can't stand any more of your whistling|“Yes, Grandmother, and don’t worry, I won’t forget my water when I go wander.”
Her brothers laughed a little only because the comment was so cute. 
“Wonderful my little Wanderer, because I would hate to think of you forgetting an important rule like that.”
“I would never forget the rules, Grandmother|
